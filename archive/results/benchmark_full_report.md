|           1 | GPT-5.2         | Multiple Choice |       8 |     19.2  | The task is excellent and accurately targets the B2 level. It tests the use of a present participle clause ('citing') to give a reason, which is a sophisticated structure relevant to the writing skills described. The distractors are well-chosen and test understanding of conjunctions and linking words. The only minor flaw is that the 'correctAnswer' field is a string instead of an array, which misinterprets a slightly ambiguous instruction.                                                                                   |
|           1 | GPT-5.2         | Fill Blank      |       8 |     10.27 | The candidate created a high-quality B2 grammar task testing the distinction between prepositions ('despite') and conjunctions ('even though'). The sentence is natural and the context is appropriate. The primary weakness is that the answer is not strictly unique, as 'In spite of' is also a valid answer, which goes against the prompt's guideline for a deterministic answer. However, the task itself is well-conceived and targets a key B2 skill.                                                                                 |
|           1 | Gemini 3 Flash  | Multiple Choice |       9 |      1.23 | An excellent and challenging task that is well-suited for the B2/C1 level. It tests knowledge of formal vocabulary (the phrasal verb 'adhere to') in a professional context. It also implicitly tests the subjunctive mood ('insisted that the team adhere...'), a key feature of more advanced grammar. This aligns well with writing formal reports. The only minor issue is the 'correctAnswer' format being a string instead of an array.                                                                                                 |
|           1 | Gemini 3 Flash  | Fill Blank      |       6 |      1.12 | The vocabulary word 'justification' and the formal context are well-suited for the B2 level. However, the task's effectiveness is severely diminished because the hint '(justification)' is the answer itself. Additionally, the answer is not deterministic, as both 'reason' and 'explanation' are also perfectly suitable answers.                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
|           1 | Llama 4         | Multiple Choice |       6 |      0.39 | The task is grammatically correct and clearly constructed, but the skill it tests—using the present simple for a general truth—is more characteristic of the B1 level. A B2 learner would be expected to have mastered this point. While the sentence context is pleasant, the task does not sufficiently challenge a B2 student or align with the complexity described in the proficiency level.                                                                                                                                             |
|           1 | Llama 4         | Fill Blank      |       7 |      0.66 | This is an excellent grammar task that tests the past perfect continuous, a core B2-level tense, in a well-constructed sentence that makes the answer highly deterministic. The quality of the linguistic task is very high. However, it completely fails to follow the instruction to include a hint for the missing word in parentheses, which is a significant omission.                                                                                                                                                                   |
|           1 | Mistral Large 3 | Multiple Choice |       9 |      2.15 | This is an outstanding B2/C1 level task. It tests a nuanced grammatical point: the use of the perfect participle ('having been stuck') to sequence past events clearly. This is a key skill for creating detailed narratives, aligning perfectly with the proficiency description. The distractors are grammatically relevant, and the task correctly follows all formatting guidelines, including the array format for 'correctAnswer'.                                                                                                      |
|           1 | Mistral Large 3 | Fill Blank      |       5 |      1.44 | The task correctly identifies a B2-level phrasal verb ('go ahead with'). However, it fails on two key points: 1) The hint '(go ahead)' is the answer itself, making the task trivial. 2) The answer is not unique; 'proceed' is also a valid and common alternative. This undermines the task's utility as an assessment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
|           1 | Qwen 3 Max      | Multiple Choice |       7 |      8.56 | A solid B2 task focusing on vocabulary precision and collocation ('disappoint their fans'). The sentence structure is appropriate for the level, using a concessive clause ('Despite...') and a relative clause. However, the vocabulary itself is fairly common, making the task slightly less challenging than other candidates. The 'correctAnswer' format is a string, not an array.                                                                                                                                                      |
|           1 | Qwen 3 Max      | Fill Blank      |       4 |      2.22 | This submission has several flaws. The vocabulary word 'attend' is closer to a B1 level than B2. Similar to other candidates, it provides the answer as the hint, which removes any challenge. Furthermore, the answer is not unique ('go to' is a common alternative), violating a key instruction.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
|           2 | GPT-5.2         | Multiple Choice |       8 |      8.48 | This is a strong B2 vocabulary task. The context of writing a report directly aligns with the proficiency description. The options test for precise word choice ('allows' vs. 'persuades'), which is appropriate for the level. The only minor issue is the `correctAnswer` format, which the instructions ambiguously specified as an array.                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
|           2 | GPT-5.2         | Fill Blank      |       8 |     11.01 | The task correctly identifies a key B2 grammar point (the third conditional). The JSON is valid. However, it fails on the 'only one correct answer' constraint. While 'had known' is a good answer, other options like 'had been informed' or 'had been told' are also grammatically and semantically correct in this context but were not included in the `correctAnswer` array.                                                                                                                                                             |
|           2 | Gemini 3 Flash  | Multiple Choice |       9 |      1.29 | An excellent B2-level task that tests nuanced vocabulary and collocation ('hindered by'). The context, an analyst's report, is perfectly aligned with the target proficiency description. The task is clear, deterministic, and all options are plausible. It's a very strong submission, only slightly behind the top candidate due to a minor formatting interpretation.                                                                                                                                                                    |
|           2 | Gemini 3 Flash  | Fill Blank      |       9 |      1.21 | This is a very strong B2-level vocabulary task. The formal context (committee, proposal, opposition) and the target word ('proceed') are perfectly aligned with the B2 proficiency description. The task is well-constructed, and like Candidate 2, it rightly uses the parenthetical hint to guarantee a single, deterministic answer.                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
|           2 | Llama 4         | Multiple Choice |      10 |      1.41 | This is an excellent candidate that meets all criteria perfectly. It tests a subtle but important B2-level grammar point: using the simple present tense ('filters') to describe a general truth within a past narrative context. The context is appropriate, the options are good distractors, and it uniquely followed the ambiguous instruction to format the `correctAnswer` as an array.                                                                                                                                                 |
|           2 | Llama 4         | Fill Blank      |      10 |      2.43 | This is an outstanding B2-level task. It perfectly targets a key grammatical structure for this level: the past perfect continuous. The sentence context ('By the time I arrived...') makes the required tense form unambiguous, leading to a single correct answer. This is an excellent example of a well-designed, deterministic grammar question.                                                                                                                                                                                         |
|           2 | Mistral Large 3 | Multiple Choice |       6 |      1.66 | The task tests participial clauses, a valid B2 grammar point. However, it violates guideline #8 by not being deterministic. Both 'reviewing' and 'having reviewed' are grammatically correct options in this context, creating ambiguity and allowing for multiple correct interpretations, which is a significant flaw in a multiple-choice question.                                                                                                                                                                                        |
|           2 | Mistral Large 3 | Fill Blank      |       9 |      1.53 | This is a strong B2-level task. It tests a common three-part phrasal verb ('go ahead with') within a natural sentence structure using 'Despite...'. The use of the hint in parentheses is a clever and standard testing method to ensure a single correct answer, fully complying with the instructions. The format is perfect.                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
|           2 | Qwen 3 Max      | Multiple Choice |       7 |      3.65 | The task is grammatically correct and deterministic. However, the grammatical point being tested (verb pattern 'insist on' + gerund) is more characteristic of a B1 level. While a B2 learner should know this, it doesn't effectively challenge them or align with the higher-level skills described in the B2 profile.                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
|           2 | Qwen 3 Max      | Fill Blank      |       6 |      3.15 | The JSON format is correct and the sentence is well-formed. However, the task's difficulty is not appropriate for the B2 level. The target vocabulary word, 'attend', is typically mastered at the B1 level. The task does not effectively test a key B2 skill as required by the instructions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
|           3 | GPT-5.2         | Multiple Choice |       9 |      5.13 | Excellent B2-level vocabulary task in a relevant professional context. The distractors are well-chosen, and the task aligns with the goal of testing language for writing reports. A point is deducted because the 'correctAnswer' field is a string, whereas the instructions' example format strongly implied an array containing the string.                                                                                                                                                                                               |

The task is well-aligned with the B2 level. A point is deducted for not following the specified array format for the 'correctAnswer' field, providing a string instead.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

The context is appropriate and the distractors are relevant verb forms. The task is clear and has a deterministic answer. It loses points because the `correctAnswer` field is a string, not an array of strings as specified in the instructions.                                                                                                                                                                                              |

The professional context is appropriate. The only minor weakness is that 'in spite of' is also a correct answer, but it was not included in the 'correctAnswer' array. However, for a single blank, 'despite' is the more concise and likely intended answer.                                                                                        |

The target word 'undermined' is perfectly suited for the level, and the distractors are excellent choices, being semantically related or morphologically similar. The business context is appropriate and the sentence is natural. The task is clear and deterministic. The only flaw is a minor format deviation, where `correctAnswer` is a string instead of the requested array.                                                                                                               |

However, the task fails on the 'only one correct answer' guideline. The blank could be filled with many synonyms like 'reviewing', 'evaluating', 'discussing', or 'analyzing', making it highly ambiguous without the hint.                                                                                                                                                                        |
|           4 | Llama 4         | Multiple Choice |       2 |      3.21 | This candidate is deeply flawed. Firstly, it violates a guideline by lifting a phrase directly from the level description in the prompt ('highlights the personal significance of events and experiences'). More critically, the task is grammatically incorrect; the parallel structure 'both engaging and ___' requires an adjective ('objective'), but the provided `correctAnswer` is an adverb ('objectively'). This makes the question invalid. The only positive is that it correctly formatted the `correctAnswer` field as an array. |

It correctly identifies and tests a key structure for this level: the Past Perfect Continuous tense. The time markers 'By the time I arrived' and 'for months' create a strong context that makes the required tense almost unique and unambiguous. This is a well-designed, deterministic grammar question.                                                                                                                                                                                            |

However, the task violates the guideline for a deterministic answer, as the option 'being stuck' is also grammatically correct and very common in this context, making the question ambiguous. It also fails to follow the specified format for the `correctAnswer` field (string instead of array).                                                                                                                         |

The blank can be filled with numerous other verbs besides 'continue' (e.g., 'start', 'begin', 'make', 'pursue'), making the question highly ambiguous. It relies entirely on the parenthetical hint '(continue)' to be solvable, which indicates poor question design.                                                                                                                                                                         |

It correctly tests the meaning of the phrasal verb 'proceed with' in a clear context. The distractors are logical antonyms, making the question a good test of comprehension. The answer is deterministic and the level is appropriate. It only loses a point for a minor format error, providing the `correctAnswer` as a string instead of an array.                                                                                                                                     |

The blank is not deterministic, as several other verbs would fit the context perfectly (e.g., 'go to', 'watch'). The question is only answerable because of the hint '(attend)', not because of linguistic constraints in the sentence, which makes it a weak assessment item.                                                                                                                                                                                |

It effectively tests the learner's ability to distinguish between words with similar meanings ('disappoint' vs. 'discourage', etc.) within a complex sentence. This skill of choosing the precise word is crucial for the clear and detailed writing expected at B2. The context is clear and the options are well-chosen.                                                                                                                                                                                       |

The sentence is natural and the answer 'had had' is deterministically correct. The score is slightly reduced because the 'had had' structure can be phonetically confusing, and the parenthetical hint `(had more time)` is a slightly awkward interpretation of the prompt's instruction to provide the 'missing word/phrase in English'.                                                                                                                             |

It violates the core instruction to have only one correct answer. Many verbs like 'reviewing', 'evaluating', and 'discussing' fit the blank perfectly, making the question highly ambiguous and non-deterministic.                                                                                                                                                                               |

First, it violates the formatting guidelines by omitting the required parenthetical hint in the question string. Second, the answer is not strictly deterministic, as the past perfect simple ('had worked on') could also be considered grammatically acceptable.                                                                                                                                                                   |

However, the options 'adjusted' and 'adapted' can be nearly interchangeable in the given context for many speakers, which slightly violates the 'deterministic' answer guideline. Additionally, the 'correctAnswer' field is formatted as an array instead of a string, which is a minor deviation from the standard interpretation of the prompt.                                                                                                      |

The vocabulary item 'postpone' is appropriate for the level and context. However, it violates the strict instruction that the missing word must have only one correct answer, as 'delay' (the word in the hint) and 'reschedule' are also valid and natural-sounding options.

It strictly adheres to all guidelines regarding format, content, and the absence of instructions, resulting in a high-quality, unambiguous language task.                                                                                                                                                                                            |

However, it completely fails the critical instruction to have only one correct answer. Multiple verbs like 'detailing', 'explaining', and 'describing' are perfect synonyms for 'outlining' in this context, making the question highly ambiguous.                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
|           8 | Llama 4         | Multiple Choice |       4 |      1.59 | While the linguistic content is excellent for a B2 vocabulary task, the candidate fails significantly on following instructions. It includes instructions ('Complete the sentence...') inside the question field, violating a direct negative constraint. It also fails to use the specified JSON structure for the correct answer, providing an index instead of the string value.                                                                                                                                                           |

However, it fails on two counts: it violates a direct instruction by omitting the missing word in parentheses, and the answer is not unique, as 'use' is an equally valid alternative to 'take'.                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

The task is clear and follows all formatting rules. While the context is slightly less complex than other candidates, the grammatical point is perfectly suited for the B2 level.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
|           8 | Mistral Large 3 | Fill Blank      |       5 |      1.39 | The task is grammatically correct but fails on two key points. Firstly, the level is closer to B1, as it tests a simple infinitive structure rather than a complex B2 skill. Secondly, it violates the 'only one correct answer' rule, as words like 'resume' or 'begin' would also fit the blank.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
|           8 | Qwen 3 Max      | Multiple Choice |       5 |      3.66 | This task is weaker because it violates the 'avoid ambiguity' rule. The provided correct answer ('doing' her run) is a less common and natural collocation than other possibilities (e.g., 'going for' or 'taking'), which could confuse a learner. The difficulty level is also closer to B1 than the requested B2.                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

The time marker 'by tomorrow' makes the answer highly specific and deterministic in a testing context. The submission follows all instructions perfectly.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
|           9 | GPT-5.2         | Multiple Choice |       9 |      4.96 | A very strong task that correctly tests connectors of concession ('Despite'), a key skill for B2-level writing. The context of a 'detailed report' aligns perfectly with the proficiency description. The options are clear, and the answer is unambiguous. The format is correct.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
|           9 | GPT-5.2         | Fill Blank      |      10 |     27    | This is an excellent B2-level task. It correctly tests the second conditional, a key grammatical structure for this level. The context is relevant and natural. Crucially, this was the only candidate to interpret the instruction for a hint (e.g., '(possessed)') in a pedagogically sound way, providing a synonym rather than the answer itself. This creates a genuine test of the learner's knowledge, unlike the other candidates. The format is perfect.                                                                             |
|           9 | Gemini 3 Flash  | Multiple Choice |      10 |      1.56 | This is an outstanding B2-level task. It tests nuanced vocabulary by requiring the selection of the most precise adjective ('detrimental') in a formal context. This skill is directly relevant to the B2 ability to write clear, detailed reports. The distractors are plausible but less appropriate, making the correct answer clear and deterministic.                                                                                                                                                                                    |
|           9 | Gemini 3 Flash  | Fill Blank      |       4 |      1.34 | This candidate has multiple flaws. First, like others, it gives the answer away in the hint ('reach/arrive at'). Second, it violates the instructions by creating ambiguity: the hint suggests two possible correct answers ('reach' and 'arrive at'), but the `correctAnswer` field only lists one ('reach'). The instructions explicitly state to return all correct answers in the array. This internal inconsistency makes it a poorly constructed task.                                                                                  |
|           9 | Llama 4         | Multiple Choice |      10 |      1.74 | An excellent task that perfectly meets all instructions. It tests word forms ('anecdotal'), a crucial skill for writing accuracy at the B2 level. The vocabulary is appropriate, the context is modern and engaging, and the options create a clear, unambiguous choice. The JSON format, including the array for 'correctAnswer', is a valid interpretation of the prompt.                                                                                                                                                                   |
|           9 | Llama 4         | Fill Blank      |       7 |      0.47 | The task tests the past perfect continuous, an excellent and challenging grammar point for the B2 level, and the sentence construction is perfect for it. The task is of high quality in principle. However, like other candidates, it provides the exact answer in the hint, which fundamentally undermines the purpose of the assessment. It scores slightly higher than others with the same flaw due to the strength of the chosen grammar point.                                                                                         |
|           9 | Mistral Large 3 | Multiple Choice |       8 |      1.77 | This is a solid grammar task testing the use of a gerund after a preposition ('After being stuck'). The format is correct and the answer is unambiguous. However, the grammatical point is arguably at the lower end of the B2 level, making it slightly less challenging than other candidates' submissions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
|           9 | Mistral Large 3 | Fill Blank      |       6 |      1.58 | The task correctly identifies a B2-level phrasal verb ('go ahead with') and places it in a natural sentence structure. However, the task is critically flawed because the hint provided in parentheses is the exact answer, turning a vocabulary test into a simple copying exercise. This fails to assess the learner's actual knowledge.                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
|           9 | Qwen 3 Max      | Multiple Choice |       8 |      3.98 | A good B2 vocabulary task focusing on collocations ('lift her mood'). The context is appropriate. The primary weakness is that 'elevate' could also be considered a possible, if less common, answer, which slightly reduces the determinism of the question. 'Lift' is the most idiomatic choice, but the ambiguity is a minor flaw.                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
|           9 | Qwen 3 Max      | Fill Blank      |       6 |      3.57 | This candidate successfully targets a common B2-level collocation ('make a breakthrough') within a relevant context. The task's value is significantly diminished, however, because the hint '(made)' is the literal answer. This removes any challenge and does not effectively test the learner's vocabulary knowledge.                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

Crucially, it adheres to the guideline of having a single, deterministic correct answer ('had had'), a point where most other candidates failed. The JSON format is correct. The only minor point is the somewhat unusual hint '(possessed)' instead of the base verb '(have)', but it is a valid and challenging way to prompt the correct verb.                                   |

The format is valid. However, the task violates the key guideline of being deterministic. Other verbs, such as 'proceed' or 'continue', would also fit the blank grammatically and contextually. The candidate should have either constructed a more constrained sentence or listed all possible correct answers in the array.                                                                                     |

The target vocabulary word, 'attend', is typically learned at the B1 level. Furthermore, like other candidates, it fails the determinism test, as 'go to' is an equally valid and common answer which was not included in the 'correctAnswer' array. The sentence structure is acceptable, but the core task does not meet the required proficiency standard.                                                                                                                           |

The context is appropriate, and all options are plausible distractors. The only deduction is for a minor format error: the 'correctAnswer' field should contain an array with the string, not just the string itself, as specified in the instructions ('in array').                                                                                                                                            |

However, it fails the critical 'only one correct answer' rule. Words like 'pinpoint,' 'determine,' or the hint-word 'recognize' are all valid alternatives to 'identify', making the question ambiguous.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

However, the candidate fails a key negative constraint by including instructions ('Choose the most appropriate word...') in the 'question' field, which was explicitly forbidden. It also has a minor format error with the 'correctAnswer' field.                                                                                                                            |

It tests relevant vocabulary ('proposal,' 'residents,' 'opposed') within a suitable context. Crucially, it best adheres to the 'only one correct answer' rule. The strong collocation of 'strongly opposed to' makes 'opposed' the most natural and expected answer, effectively minimizing ambiguity.                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
|          11 | Llama 4         | Multiple Choice |       2 |      0.69 | This candidate fails on multiple fundamental guidelines. The 'question' field is not a single sentence; it contains a long preamble that copies parts of the original instruction and explicitly includes instructions for the user ('I need to choose the correct word...'). This violates guidelines #1, #9, and #10. The output demonstrates a poor understanding of the prompt's constraints.                                                                                                                                             |

'Increase,' 'improve,' and 'raise' are all perfect synonyms for 'boost' in this context, directly violating the strict 'only one correct answer' guideline.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
|          11 | Mistral Large 3 | Multiple Choice |       9 |      1.92 | This is a strong candidate that follows all instructions, including the JSON format for 'correctAnswer' as an array. The task effectively tests B2-level vocabulary by distinguishing between similar words and different word forms ('adapt' vs 'adopt', 'adjustment', 'adaptation'). While the context is general, the task is well-constructed and deterministic.                                                                                                                                                                          |
|          11 | Mistral Large 3 | Fill Blank      |       5 |      1.48 | The sentence structure is acceptable, but the overall vocabulary and the target word 'continue' are closer to a B1 level. More importantly, the task is ambiguous, as 'have our picnic' or 'hold our picnic' are equally valid and common answers, violating a key instruction.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

It does not adequately challenge a B2 learner's ability to write detailed essays or reports as described in the proficiency description. It also fails to format the 'correctAnswer' as an array.                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
|          11 | Qwen 3 Max      | Fill Blank      |       7 |      3.96 | This candidate correctly targets a B2 grammar point ('insisted on' + gerund), which is a strong feature. The sentence is natural. However, it does not have a unique answer, as 'going to' is a very common and correct alternative to 'attending', making the task ambiguous.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

The sentence structure is complex and appropriate for the level. It loses points only because its literal interpretation of the instructions (placing the answer in parentheses) makes the task trivial for the learner, although it is technically compliant.                                                                                                     |

However, it fundamentally fails by not including 'considering' in the `correctAnswer` array, even though it's a valid and even more common answer. This makes the provided solution incorrect and violates the deterministic answer rule.                                                                                                                                     |

However, it fails on two instructions: it completely omits the required hint in parentheses, and the question is not deterministic as 'went into effect' is also a correct answer. This violates two key guidelines.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

However, it violates the critical instruction for the answer to be deterministic, as 'proceed with' is also a valid and common answer. Like other candidates, it also gives the answer away in the question's hint, reducing its value as a test item.                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

While a synonym like 'refuted' could be argued, 'denied' is by far the most common and direct fit for the grammatical structure '...____ that...', making the question highly effective and nearly deterministic.                                                                                                    |
|          15 | Llama 4         | Multiple Choice |       2 |      1.63 | This candidate fails on multiple critical guidelines. 1) It violates the 'no instructions' rule by adding 'Complete the sentence...' to the question. 2) The answer is not deterministic; all four options are grammatically correct and plausible ways to make someone feel at ease, making the question subjective. 3) The JSON format is incorrect, including an unrequested 'correct' field. 4) The language complexity is closer to B1 than B2.                                                                                          |

The JSON format is invalid and does not match the requested structure. It violates guideline #10 by omitting the English translation in parentheses. Most importantly, the generated task ('The company will ____ the contract...') is highly ambiguous with many possible answers ('sign', 'renew', 'terminate', 'extend'), directly contradicting the 'only one correct answer' rule.                                                                                            |
|          15 | Mistral Large 3 | Multiple Choice |      10 |      2.03 | An excellent B2 grammar task. It precisely tests the use of the passive gerund ('being stuck') after a preposition, a key grammar point at this level. The context is relatable, and the distractors represent common learner errors, making it a well-designed and effective question. It follows all instructions perfectly.                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

The main weakness is its failure to adhere to the 'only one correct answer' rule. Besides 'carry out', other phrasal verbs like 'go ahead with' or 'follow through with' would also fit the context, making the question ambiguous.                                                                                                                                                                                        |

The sentence uses a B2-level structure ('Despite...'), and the correct answer ('proceed with') requires understanding beyond simple word definition. The distractors are thematically relevant but semantically incorrect, ensuring a single right answer.                                                                                                                                                                                               |

The task tests a key B2 grammar point (present perfect continuous with 'since'). Crucially, it adheres to the 'only one correct answer' constraint, as 'since' is the only grammatically correct and natural option in this context. The level and context are entirely appropriate.                                                                                                                                                                   |

It perfectly aligns with the A1 skill description of 'fill in forms with personal details' by testing the user's ability to identify the correct type of information (a phone number) for a specific field ('Telefon'). The question is a single, clear sentence fragment. The options are distinct and well-chosen, making the answer deterministic. It creatively adapts the multiple-choice format to test a skill related to writing production and follows all guidelines flawlessly.                                                         |
|           1 | GPT-5.2         | Fill Blank      |       8 |      1.67 | The task is highly relevant to the A1 level description, which explicitly mentions writing a postcard. The Polish sentence is grammatically correct, and 'pocztówkę' is the correct accusative form. However, the instruction to 'avoid ambiguity' and have 'only one correct answer' is not perfectly met, as 'kartę pocztową' (used by Candidate 3) is an equally valid answer. The task is good but not strictly deterministic as required.                                                                                                                            |
|           1 | Gemini 3 Flash  | Multiple Choice |      10 |      1.06 | This is an outstanding task. It tests a crucial A1 grammar point (the locative case with 'mieszkam w...') within a single, natural sentence. This skill is directly applicable to writing personal details on a form or in a short introductory text, aligning perfectly with the proficiency description. The options are the different grammatical cases of the same noun, creating a focused and effective question for an A1 learner. It adheres strictly to all guidelines.                                                                                          |

It tests a core A1 verb ('mieszkać' - to live) in the context of a personal introduction, which relates to the A1 skill of providing personal details. The sentence is grammatically correct, natural, and 'mieszkam' is the single, unambiguous correct answer. The candidate followed all instructions perfectly, including the JSON format.                                                                                                                                                                                         |
|           1 | Llama 4         | Multiple Choice |       2 |      1.89 | This candidate fails on multiple critical points. It violates the 'single sentence' guideline by providing a three-sentence context. More importantly, the task is fundamentally broken due to a grammatical error. The correct answer requires the locative case ('w parku'), but the option provided is the nominative/accusative ('park'), making none of the options both contextually and grammatically correct. The context also does not align closely with the specified writing skill.                                                                           |

|           1 | Mistral Large 3 | Multiple Choice |       4 |      2.03 | The task contains two significant flaws. First, it violates the guideline 'Do not include any instructions for the task' by including 'Wybierz poprawną formę czasownika:' in the question string. Second, the question 'Codziennie ______ kawę w kawiarni' is ambiguous without an explicit subject pronoun (e.g., Ja, Ty, On), making multiple options potentially correct depending on the assumed context. This violates the 'deterministic' answer guideline.                                                                                                        |

It tests fundamental vocabulary ('jestem z...') and grammar (the verb 'być') used for personal introductions. This aligns perfectly with the A1 skill of filling in personal details. The sentence is natural, and 'jestem' is the only correct and unambiguous answer. The JSON format is valid and all instructions were followed.                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

However, it violates a key negative constraint by including a direct command, 'Wpisz swoje imię i nazwisko w formularzu:', in the question field, which the instructions explicitly forbade ('Do not include any instructions for the task'). If the question had been framed as a sentence to complete, it would have been excellent.                                                                                                                                         |
|           1 | Qwen 3 Max      | Fill Blank      |       8 |      3.88 | Similar to Candidate 1, this task is very well-aligned with the A1 level description concerning sending holiday greetings. The sentence is grammatically correct and 'kartę pocztową' is a correct answer. The issue is the same as with Candidate 1: 'pocztówkę' is also a valid answer, which means the task is not as deterministic as the instructions required.                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

The context 'W formularzu:' is a direct and effective cue. The question tests a fundamental grammar point (1st person singular conjugation of 'być') with clear, relevant distractors. It adheres to all guidelines, including having no instructions in the question. The only minor imperfection is that the `correctAnswer` is a string instead of an array, but this is a reasonable interpretation given the conflicting examples in the original prompt. |
|           2 | GPT-5.2         | Fill Blank      |      10 |      1.19 | Excellent task. The context 'Pozdrowienia z...' (Greetings from...) directly aligns with the A1 level description of writing a postcard. The answer 'gór' correctly tests both vocabulary (mountains) and a key grammatical concept for this level (the genitive case after the preposition 'z'). The task is unambiguous and follows all instructions perfectly.                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
|           2 | Gemini 3 Flash  | Multiple Choice |       6 |      1.42 | The vocabulary tested (personal details like 'imię', 'nazwisko') is perfectly suited for the A1 level and the context of filling in a form. The task is clear and the correct answer is unambiguous. However, like Candidate 2, it violates guideline #9 by including instructions ('Proszę wypełnić formularz.') in the question field, which is a major deviation from the prompt's requirements.                                                                                                                                                                       |

It tests a core A1 verb ('mieszkać') in its first-person conjugation, which is a fundamental skill. Most importantly, the answer 'mieszkam' is unambiguous in this context, fulfilling all the prompt's guidelines flawlessly.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

The task directly and cleverly targets the A1 skill of filling in personal details on a form. It tests a practical and important piece of knowledge: using numerals for addresses. The distractors are well-chosen to test different forms of the number. The JSON format is perfect, adhering to all instructions, including providing the `correctAnswer` in an array.                                                                                                                          |

While 'pochodzę' is a correct answer for '(am from)', so is 'jestem'. The task violates the guideline requiring a single, deterministic answer (or providing all possible correct answers), which makes it a flawed assessment item.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
|           2 | Mistral Large 3 | Multiple Choice |       5 |      2.31 | The task itself, testing present tense verb conjugation, is appropriate for A1. However, it explicitly violates guideline #9 by including instructions ('Wybierz poprawną formę czasownika:') within the 'question' field. This is a significant failure to follow the prompt's negative constraints. Additionally, the context of 'running in the park' is less directly related to the specified writing skills (forms, short messages) than other candidates' submissions.                                                                                             |
|           2 | Mistral Large 3 | Fill Blank      |       5 |      1.62 | The task is level-appropriate, testing the verb 'być' in a personal introduction context. However, it violates a key guideline by being ambiguous. Both 'jestem' and 'pochodzę' are correct and common answers for '(am from)'. The instruction states the answer must be deterministic or all correct answers must be provided. This task fails on that criterion.                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
|           2 | Qwen 3 Max      | Multiple Choice |       7 |      5.41 | The candidate successfully created a task that follows the structural rules and uses a relevant context ('napisałem krótką wiadomość'). However, the grammatical complexity of the sentence, which uses a subordinate clause ('że...'), and the inclusion of a conditional form ('byłbym') as a distractor, pushes the difficulty slightly beyond the A1 level and closer to A2. While testing the past tense is appropriate, the overall sentence structure is more challenging than ideal for an A1 learner.                                                            |
|           2 | Qwen 3 Max      | Fill Blank      |       3 |      3.76 | The concept of sending a postcard is highly relevant to the A1 level description. However, the task contains a significant linguistic error. The Polish word for 'postcard' is 'kartka pocztowa' or 'pocztówka', not 'karta'. The provided answers ('kartę', 'kartę pocztową') are grammatically incorrect forms of the wrong noun, making the task inaccurate and misleading for a learner.                                                                                                                                                                              |

The question is clear, and the distractors are very well-chosen for the A1 level, testing the difference between the country name, adjective, and nationality. It only loses a point for a minor format deviation (`correctAnswer` as a string instead of an array), which was caused by an ambiguous instruction.                                                                                                                                                   |

More importantly, the task quality is very low; it's a simple comprehension task with completely unrelated distractors, rather than a test of a specific grammar or vocabulary point suitable for writing skills.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

Firstly, it violates the 'only one correct answer' rule, as 'pocztówkę' is a common synonym for 'kartę pocztową' and would also fit. Secondly, the grammatical complexity (past tense verb + multiple noun cases) is more appropriate for an A2 level than A1.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

The sentence is natural and the options are well-chosen. However, it fails to strictly follow the JSON format guideline. The `correctAnswer` field should be an array (e.g., `["dane"]`) as implied by the prompt's structure, but it was provided as a string.                                                                                                                                                                              |

It tests a key vocabulary item ('góry') and its correct grammatical case (genitive) within a very common, natural phrase ('Pozdrawiam... z...'). The task is perfectly level-appropriate and adheres to all instructions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
|           4 | Gemini 3 Flash  | Multiple Choice |       8 |      1.56 | This is a perfect A1 task testing fundamental verb conjugation, which is highly relevant to the level and writing skill. The context is excellent and the task is clear. However, like Candidate 1, it fails to adhere to the strict JSON format requirement for the `correctAnswer` field, providing a string ('mieszkam') instead of an array `["mieszkam"]`.                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

The task is a perfectly constructed A1 grammar question testing the locative case, a key skill for the level. The context of stating a location is highly relevant for writing. It adheres strictly to all guidelines, including providing a clean question without instructions and using the correct array format for the `correctAnswer` field. The distractors are excellent, representing common case-related errors.                                                                                                            |

It correctly tests a key grammatical concept (the locative case) and basic vocabulary. While slightly more generic than the postcard-themed tasks, it's highly effective, accurate, and level-appropriate.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

It correctly uses an array for the `correctAnswer` field. However, it explicitly violates guideline #9 by including instructions ('Wybierz poprawne słowo:') within the 'question' field, which was forbidden. The context is also more generic than other candidates.                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

The sentence is natural and highly relevant. A minor point is deducted because an alternative answer ('pochodzę') is also grammatically possible, though less common at A1, creating a slight ambiguity.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

It violates guideline #9 by including an instruction ('Wpisz swoje imię i nazwisko w formularzu:') in the 'question' field. It also fails to use the correct array format for the `correctAnswer` field. While the context of 'filling a form' is relevant, the task design is more about pragmatic comprehension than a specific grammar or vocabulary point, making it a less effective language task.                                                                                                                               |

It tests a crucial vocabulary item ('karta pocztowa') and the appropriate grammatical case (accusative), making it highly relevant and perfectly targeted for an A1 learner. All instructions are followed flawlessly.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

The question is framed cleverly as a statement ('In the form I write: ...') to avoid giving a direct instruction, which follows the guidelines strictly. The options correctly test first-person singular verb conjugation. The only minor flaw is that the `correctAnswer` is a string instead of an array, which was specified in the prompt's example format.                                                                      |

The vocabulary ('serdecznie') is appropriate, the sentence is natural, and the answer is unambiguous. It follows all instructions precisely.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
|           5 | Gemini 3 Flash  | Multiple Choice |       9 |      1.24 | This is an excellent task, almost identical to Candidate 1. It perfectly aligns with the A1 level by testing first-person verb conjugation within the context of providing personal details, which is directly relevant to the 'filling in forms' or 'writing a postcard' skill. It avoids instructions and provides clear, unambiguous options. Like Candidate 1, its only minor imperfection is providing the `correctAnswer` as a string instead of an array.                                                                                                          |
|           5 | Gemini 3 Flash  | Fill Blank      |      10 |      1.23 | A classic and well-constructed A1 task. It tests the present tense conjugation of a core verb ('mieszkać') within a common, everyday context. The sentence is natural, the level is appropriate, and the answer is unambiguous, adhering to all guidelines.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
|           5 | Llama 4         | Multiple Choice |       8 |      0.62 | This is a very strong linguistic task. It correctly targets a common A1-level error in Polish (using 'to be' instead of 'to have' for age) and follows all technical guidelines, including the JSON format and avoiding instructions. The options are well-designed distractors. The only reason it doesn't score higher is that it uses a general 'daily life' context rather than referencing the specific 'form' or 'postcard' context mentioned in the proficiency description, which other candidates successfully incorporated.                                     |
|           5 | Llama 4         | Fill Blank      |       3 |      0.36 | The task is fundamentally flawed because it violates the key instruction that the answer must be deterministic and have only one correct option. The blank in 'Mieszkam w _____' could be filled with 'mieście' (city), but also with any city name in the locative case (e.g., 'Warszawie', 'Krakowie'), making the question highly ambiguous.                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
|           5 | Mistral Large 3 | Multiple Choice |       6 |      2.66 | The task itself is a valid A1-level grammar question. However, it violates a key guideline by including an explicit instruction: 'Wybierz poprawną formę czasownika:' ('Choose the correct verb form:'). The prompt explicitly stated 'Do not include any instructions for the task'. Additionally, while the context is level-appropriate, it does not specifically relate to the writing skill examples ('postcard', 'form') provided in the level description. On the positive side, the JSON format, including the `correctAnswer` as an array, is perfect.           |
|           5 | Mistral Large 3 | Fill Blank      |      10 |      1.52 | A perfect example of a foundational A1 task. It tests the verb 'być' (to be) in a core context of personal introduction ('Jestem z Polski'). The task is clear, grammatically correct, and has a single, deterministic answer.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
|           5 | Qwen 3 Max      | Multiple Choice |       4 |      3.9  | This candidate fails on several points. Firstly, it provides an instruction ('Wpisz swoje imię i nazwisko w formularzu:') instead of a sentence completion task, violating a negative constraint. Secondly, the task tests reading comprehension of the instruction rather than a productive writing skill like grammar or vocabulary in context. Thirdly, the distractors are too dissimilar from the correct answer, making the task trivial. It doesn't effectively test a specific, meaningful skill aligned with the level.                                          |
|           5 | Qwen 3 Max      | Fill Blank      |      10 |      4.06 | This candidate also created an excellent task that directly references the level description's mention of writing a postcard. It correctly tests A1 vocabulary ('pocztówka') and the necessary grammatical case (accusative), making it a well-designed and relevant question.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
|           6 | GPT-5.2         | Multiple Choice |       7 |     21.75 | The task is grammatically correct and appropriate for the A1 level, testing a common preposition of direction ('chodzić na'). However, it deviates from the specified JSON format by including an extra field ('question_en') and providing the 'correctAnswer' as a string instead of an array. The task itself is solid for A1 learners.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
|           6 | GPT-5.2         | Fill Blank      |      10 |      1.06 | The task is excellent. It perfectly aligns with the A1 level description by using vocabulary and a sentence structure ('Pozdrawiam z...') typical for writing a postcard. The question tests both vocabulary ('góry') and a key grammatical concept for this level (the genitive case after the preposition 'z'). The answer is unambiguous and the format is correct.                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
|           6 | Gemini 3 Flash  | Multiple Choice |       9 |      1.73 | This is an excellent A1-level task. It tests a fundamental skill (conjugation for 'nazywać się') in a very common and natural context (introductions). The question is clear, unambiguous, and perfectly suited for the level. The only flaw is a minor format deviation where 'correctAnswer' is a string instead of an array as specified in the prompt's example.                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
|           6 | Gemini 3 Flash  | Fill Blank      |      10 |      1.27 | This is another excellent example of a core A1 task. It's very similar to Candidate 2 but uses the phrase 'Nazywam się...' instead of 'Mam na imię...'. It correctly tests the verb 'być' in the context of personal introductions and origin, which is fundamental for this level. The task is clear, accurate, and adheres to all guidelines.                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
|           6 | Llama 4         | Multiple Choice |       7 |      2.54 | The task is well-constructed, testing the genitive case after a preposition of origin ('z Niemiec'), and it adheres perfectly to the JSON format. However, the sentence structure is too complex for the A1 level. A compound sentence with a relative clause ('...którzy są z...') is more characteristic of the A2 level, potentially overwhelming an A1 learner and testing reading comprehension more than the specific grammar point.                                                                                                                                |
|           6 | Llama 4         | Fill Blank      |       5 |      1.33 | While the topic (personal details) is A1 and the format is correct, the Polish sentence is grammatically incorrect and unnatural. The phrase 'Mam na nazwisko...' is not followed by both a first and last name. One would say 'Mam na nazwisko Nowak' or 'Nazywam się Anna Nowak'. This inaccuracy makes it a poor and confusing task for a language learner.                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
|           6 | Mistral Large 3 | Multiple Choice |       6 |      2.35 | This candidate violates a key guideline by including an instruction ('Wybierz poprawną formę czasownika:') within the 'question' field. While the JSON format is otherwise correct, and the task tests a core A1 skill (verb conjugation), the lack of an explicit subject pronoun ('ja', 'my') makes the question slightly ambiguous, although 'idę' is the most probable answer in a test context. The prompt required a deterministic answer.                                                                                                                          |
|           6 | Mistral Large 3 | Fill Blank      |      10 |      1.53 | This is a quintessential A1 task. It tests a fundamental concept: personal introductions and stating one's origin ('jestem z Polski'). The grammar is simple and correct, the vocabulary is core A1, and the context aligns with the 'filling in personal details' part of the proficiency description. The JSON format is valid and follows all instructions.                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
|           6 | Qwen 3 Max      | Multiple Choice |       5 |      4.35 | This task directly tests the ability to recognize personal details for a form, which aligns well with the proficiency description. However, it fails on several guidelines: the 'question' is an explicit instruction, not a sentence for completion; the 'correctAnswer' is a string instead of an array; and the distractors are too simple and unrelated to the correct answer, making it a test of basic vocabulary recognition rather than a nuanced language choice.                                                                                                |
|           6 | Qwen 3 Max      | Fill Blank      |      10 |      4.86 | An outstanding task that directly and creatively uses the example from the level description ('writing a postcard'). It tests a relevant vocabulary word ('pocztówka') and the accusative case, which is a crucial grammatical point for A1/A2 learners. The use of the past tense ('wysłałem') is appropriate and often introduced at this stage. The format is correct.                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

It is simple, clear, and adheres to most instructions. It loses points for a minor format deviation ('correctAnswer' is a string, not an array as in the prompt's example) and for being on the very basic end of the A1 spectrum, though perfectly level-appropriate.                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

However, it violates the 'only one correct answer' rule, as 'znad morza' is an equally valid and common alternative to fill the blank, which could be constructed from two words instead of the single word 'nadmorza'.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
|           7 | Gemini 3 Flash  | Multiple Choice |       8 |      1.56 | This is a linguistically sophisticated and well-designed task. It cleverly uses grammatical gender agreement ('Jaki' + masculine noun) to create a single correct answer among contextually plausible options. This tests a deeper understanding than simple vocabulary recall. Its main flaw is violating the 'single sentence' rule by using two sentences to provide context. Despite this, the quality and cleverness of the question design are very high.                                                                                                           |

However, the candidate fails to follow a key negative constraint by including an instruction ('Wybierz poprawną formę czasownika:') directly in the 'question' field, which was explicitly forbidden.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
|           7 | Mistral Large 3 | Fill Blank      |      10 |      1.86 | An excellent A1-level task that tests a core skill (introducing oneself and stating origin) with the fundamental verb 'być' (to be). The sentence is natural, and the answer is unambiguous. It perfectly follows the instructions, although the English hint '(am from)' is slightly redundant.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
|           7 | Qwen 3 Max      | Multiple Choice |       6 |      4.4  | This candidate shows excellent understanding of the level description by creating a task directly related to filling out a form with personal details. The context is perfect. However, like Candidate 2, it violates the rule against including instructions in the question ('Wpisz swoje imię i nazwisko w formularzu:'). The high relevance to the prompt's proficiency description gives it a slight edge over Candidate 2.                                                                                                                                          |
|           7 | Qwen 3 Max      | Fill Blank      |       9 |      4.43 | A very good and relevant task, directly referencing the context of sending a postcard. It correctly tests vocabulary and the accusative case. The use of the past tense and the sentence's overall complexity place it at the higher end of the A1 level, making it slightly more challenging than a typical introductory task.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

It tests a relevant grammar point (number declension) with good distractors. The only minor flaw is that the `correctAnswer` field is a string instead of an array of strings, which could be interpreted as a slight deviation from the ambiguous instruction format.                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
|           8 | GPT-5.2         | Fill Blank      |      10 |      1.2  | This candidate is excellent. It perfectly adheres to all instructions, including the JSON format. The task directly tests vocabulary relevant to the A1 level description ('fill in forms with personal details'). The sentence is natural, grammatically correct, and the answer is unambiguous. It's a high-quality, level-appropriate task.                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
|           8 | Gemini 3 Flash  | Multiple Choice |       7 |      1.37 | The vocabulary task is perfectly suited for A1 and directly addresses the 'filling in a form' context specified in the prompt. The answer is clear and the distractors are relevant. However, it fails on two structural rules by including an instruction ('Proszę wypełnić formularz.') and not being a single sentence, which were explicit negative constraints.                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
|           8 | Gemini 3 Flash  | Fill Blank      |       9 |      1.56 | An excellent candidate that follows all instructions. The task tests a core A1 verb ('mieszkać' - to live) in the context of providing personal information, which is highly relevant for the level. The sentence is natural, grammatically correct, and the answer is deterministic. It is a well-constructed and appropriate task.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
|           8 | Llama 4         | Multiple Choice |       3 |      1.27 | This task violates several key guidelines. It is not a 'single sentence' but a short paragraph. Most importantly, it fails the 'deterministic' rule, as there are at least two semantically plausible answers ('przyjaciółmi' and 'psem'), making it a poor multiple-choice question. The context is also not aligned with the 'filling in a form' skill.                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
|           8 | Llama 4         | Fill Blank      |       1 |      0.79 | This candidate fails on multiple critical points. The generated sentence 'Mam na ______________ 'Cześć, jak się masz?'' is grammatically incorrect and nonsensical in Polish. It fails to include the required English translation of the missing word/phrase. Furthermore, one of the 'correctAnswer' options, 'imie', is misspelled (it should be 'imię'). The output is unusable.                                                                                                                                                                                      |
|           8 | Mistral Large 3 | Multiple Choice |       6 |      2.3  | The task correctly tests a core A1 grammar point (verb conjugation) with good options. However, it explicitly violates the guideline 'Do not include any instructions for the task' by adding 'Wybierz poprawne słowo:'. The JSON format for the correct answer is an array, which is a better interpretation of the instructions than a string.                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
|           8 | Mistral Large 3 | Fill Blank      |       9 |      1.69 | A very strong candidate. The task tests fundamental A1 grammar (the verb 'to be') in the context of personal introductions. The sentence is natural and correct, and it fully adheres to the format requirements. While not directly referencing postcards or forms, it aligns perfectly with the general A1 theme of sharing personal details.                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
|           8 | Qwen 3 Max      | Multiple Choice |       2 |      3.71 | This candidate has critical flaws. It violates the 'exactly four options' rule by providing a duplicate option ('szedłem'), invalidating the task format. The topic (past tense of verbs of motion) is arguably better suited for the A2 level than A1. Furthermore, the context does not relate to the specified writing skill of filling in forms.                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
|           8 | Qwen 3 Max      | Fill Blank      |       5 |      3.39 | The concept for the task is perfect, as it directly relates to the level description ('write a short, simple postcard'). However, the execution is flawed. The provided 'correctAnswer' ('kartę') is incorrect. The correct word for 'postcard' is 'kartka pocztowa' or 'kartka', and its accusative form is 'kartkę'. 'Karta' means a different type of card (e.g., credit card). This grammatical error in the answer is a significant failure for a language task.                                                                                                     |
|           9 | GPT-5.2         | Multiple Choice |       9 |     12.73 | Excellent adherence to the instructions. The task correctly targets the A1 level by testing prepositions with cities ('w Krakowie'), a core A1 grammar point. It cleverly incorporates the 'filling a form' context by framing the sentence with 'W formularzu piszę:', which respects the 'single sentence' and 'no instructions' guidelines. The options are well-chosen distractors. The only minor imperfection is using a string for 'correctAnswer' when an array may have been intended by the ambiguous prompt, but this is a negligible issue.                   |
|           9 | GPT-5.2         | Fill Blank      |       9 |      1.08 | A great task that directly relates to the A1 skill of writing a postcard. It tests a vocabulary word ('plaża') and the genitive case after 'z'. While 'jestem z Polski' is core A1, applying the genitive rule to a new noun can be challenging for the earliest A1 learners, making it a high-A1 task. The format is perfect and the question is well-formed.                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
|           9 | Gemini 3 Flash  | Multiple Choice |       4 |      1.85 | The task is a decent A1-level vocabulary question related to personal details. However, it violates two key guidelines. It uses two sentences ('Proszę wypełnić formularz. Moje ______ to Jan.') instead of the required one, and the first sentence is an explicit instruction, which breaks the 'no instructions' rule.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
|           9 | Gemini 3 Flash  | Fill Blank      |      10 |      1.47 | A perfect A1 task, functionally very similar to Candidate 2. It focuses on the core skill of introducing oneself and stating origin, testing the fundamental conjugation of 'być' ('jestem'). The sentence is natural and the answer is unambiguous and essential for any A1 learner.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
|           9 | Llama 4         | Multiple Choice |       3 |      1.37 | This candidate fails on two major points. First, the level is incorrect. It tests the instrumental case ('jest studentką'), which is an A2-level concept, not A1. An A1 learner would typically use the nominative case. Second, it violates the 'single sentence' rule by providing two sentences in the 'question' field.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
|           9 | Llama 4         | Fill Blank      |       9 |      1.39 | A solid, well-leveled task. The context of stating a birth year aligns perfectly with the A1 skill of providing personal details. It tests the use of the preposition 'w' for dates, an essential concept. The task is slightly simpler than others, focusing on a single preposition, but it remains a very good question.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
|           9 | Mistral Large 3 | Multiple Choice |       6 |      2.12 | The task itself is a very good A1-level question on present tense verb conjugation ('piję'). The context of a daily routine is appropriate. However, it explicitly violates the instruction 'Do not include any instructions for the task' by adding 'Wybierz poprawną formę czasownika:' to the question field. This is a significant deviation from the guidelines.                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
|           9 | Mistral Large 3 | Fill Blank      |      10 |      1.54 | A perfect A1 task. It targets the core skill of providing personal details by testing the first-person conjugation of 'być', the most fundamental verb in Polish. The sentence is natural, common, and the answer 'jestem' is unambiguously correct and central to A1 proficiency.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
|           9 | Qwen 3 Max      | Multiple Choice |       4 |      5.02 | This candidate violates the 'no instructions' guideline by including the command 'Wpisz swoje imię i nazwisko w formularzu:'. Furthermore, the task design is weak for a language test; it primarily tests the user's ability to understand the instruction and recognize a name, rather than testing a specific grammatical or vocabulary point within the sentence itself, as the blank represents the entire answer.                                                                                                                                                   |

The context of sending a postcard is taken directly from the A1 proficiency description. It effectively tests both A1 vocabulary ('pocztówka') and a key grammatical concept, the accusative case, which is fundamental for forming simple sentences. The format and execution are flawless.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
|          10 | GPT-5.2         | Multiple Choice |      10 |      9.7  | The candidate produced a perfectly valid JSON. The task is excellent for A1, testing a core grammatical concept (1st person verb conjugation) in a highly relevant context (personal information). It adheres to all instructions, including having a single, deterministic correct answer and avoiding instructions within the question.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
|          10 | GPT-5.2         | Fill Blank      |       7 |      1.18 | The task is good and directly relates to the postcard-writing context in the prompt. However, it violates guideline #7 regarding a single correct answer. While 'przesyłam' is a very good fit, the verb 'wysyłam' is also a correct and common alternative in this context. A truly deterministic task would either need a context that excludes one option or would have to list both in the correctAnswer array.                                                                                                                                                       |
|          10 | Gemini 3 Flash  | Multiple Choice |      10 |      1.16 | This is an exemplary A1 task that perfectly adheres to all instructions. The JSON is valid. The question tests a fundamental grammatical point (preposition 'w' for location with cities) in a context directly aligned with the A1 skill of providing personal details. The task is clear, natural, and has only one correct answer among well-chosen distractors.                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
|          10 | Gemini 3 Flash  | Fill Blank      |      10 |      1.64 | This is a perfect example of a fundamental A1 task. It tests the core verb 'mieszkać' (to live) in the context of providing personal information, which is central to the A1 level. The task is clear, the answer is unambiguous, and it fully adheres to all instructions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
|          10 | Llama 4         | Multiple Choice |       2 |      2.05 | The JSON format is valid, but the task is fundamentally broken. It fails the core requirement of having a single correct answer. All four options are grammatically and semantically correct completions for the sentence 'gram także w _______' (I also play...). This makes it an invalid multiple-choice question.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
|          10 | Llama 4         | Fill Blank      |       7 |      0.52 | The sentence itself is correct and appropriate for the A1 level. However, the candidate creates ambiguity, which is explicitly forbidden by the instructions. The English clue '(am from)' translates more directly to 'jestem z'. While 'pochodzę z' (I come from/originate from) also fits the sentence, it doesn't match the clue as well as 'jestem z' does, making the task confusing for the learner.                                                                                                                                                               |
|          10 | Mistral Large 3 | Multiple Choice |       3 |      2.37 | While the JSON format is valid, the task itself is flawed. It violates the instruction to not include instructions in the question ('Wybierz poprawną formę czasownika:'). More critically, the question is ambiguous; without an explicit subject, multiple options are grammatically correct depending on the implied pronoun (ja, ty, oni, my), violating the determinism requirement.                                                                                                                                                                                 |
|          10 | Mistral Large 3 | Fill Blank      |      10 |      1.62 | This is an excellent A1-level task. It tests a fundamental verb ('być') in the context of a personal introduction, which aligns perfectly with the level description ('fill in forms with personal details'). The clue '(am from)' makes the answer 'jestem' completely unambiguous. The format is perfect.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
|          10 | Qwen 3 Max      | Multiple Choice |       8 |      4.18 | The candidate provided a valid JSON with a good A1-level vocabulary task. The question is clear and has a single logical answer. The context of 'writing a letter' is appropriate, although it is quite close to the 'writing a postcard' example mentioned in the prompt's proficiency description, which makes it slightly less creative. The use of the past tense is acceptable for the A1 level.                                                                                                                                                                     |
|          10 | Qwen 3 Max      | Fill Blank      |      10 |      4.52 | This is a flawless candidate. It tests a key vocabulary item ('pocztówka') directly related to the prompt's context. Importantly, it also implicitly tests grammar, as the learner must provide the noun in the correct accusative case ('pocztówkę'). The English clue makes the answer deterministic. It perfectly follows all guidelines.                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
|          11 | GPT-5.2         | Multiple Choice |       9 |     15.13 | The task is excellent for the A1 level, testing the instrumental case for nationality, which aligns with providing personal details. It correctly follows most guidelines, including creating a clear, unambiguous question without instructions. The only minor flaw is that the 'correctAnswer' field is a string instead of an array, which was specified in the prompt's example format.                                                                                                                                                                              |
|          11 | GPT-5.2         | Fill Blank      |      10 |      1.1  | An excellent task that perfectly aligns with the A1 level description of 'writing a short, simple postcard'. The sentence is natural, and it correctly tests the use of the genitive case after the preposition 'z', a key grammatical point for this context. The format is valid and the answer is unambiguous.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
|          11 | Gemini 3 Flash  | Multiple Choice |       9 |      1.13 | This is a very strong candidate. The task is a classic and effective A1 exercise, testing the first-person singular conjugation of a common verb ('mieszkać') in a personal introduction context. It adheres to almost all guidelines, presenting a clean question without instructions. Similar to Candidate 1, its only minor imperfection is the 'correctAnswer' format, which is a string instead of the requested array.                                                                                                                                             |

The sentence is a very common and useful phrase for beginners. It effectively tests the conjugation of the high-frequency verb 'mieszkać' (to live/reside) in a natural context. The format is valid and the answer is unambiguous.                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

It adheres to all instructions meticulously: the JSON format is valid and correct, the question is a single sentence without instructions, and there are four clear options with one correct answer. The task itself is excellent for the A1 level, testing the distinction between a conjugated verb and a verbal noun ('bieganie') in the context of hobbies, which is a common and appropriate A1 topic.                                                                                                                   |
|          11 | Llama 4         | Fill Blank      |       1 |      1.16 | The task is fundamentally flawed. The resulting sentence, 'Mam na imię 30 lat' ('My name is 30 years old'), is nonsensical as it incorrectly merges two distinct phrases ('Mam na imię...' and 'Mam X lat'). This would severely confuse a learner. Additionally, the English cue '(imie)' is misspelled. The only positive aspect is the valid JSON structure.                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

However, it violates a key negative constraint by including an explicit instruction ('Wybierz poprawną formę czasownika:') within the 'question' field, which the prompt strictly forbade. While the JSON format is correct, this failure to follow a critical instruction significantly lowers its quality.                                                                                                                                                                  |

It tests the first-person conjugation of 'być' (to be), one of the most fundamental verbs for any beginner. The sentence is highly natural and common. The format is correct and the answer is clear.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

First, it includes an instruction ('Wpisz swoje imię i nazwisko w formularzu:') in the 'question' field. Second, the task context ('fill in forms with personal details') is almost a direct copy of the example given in the proficiency description, which the prompt asked to avoid. The JSON format also has a minor error ('correctAnswer' as a string).                                                                                                  |

It's clear, deterministic, and aligns perfectly with the proficiency level of providing personal details (where one lives). The only minor flaw is that the `correctAnswer` field is a string instead of an array, which was suggested in the prompt's example format.                                                                                                                                                                          |

However, it violates the 'only one correct answer' rule, as 'pozdrawiamy' (we greet) would also be grammatically correct in a plural context, introducing slight ambiguity.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

The task perfectly targets the A1 level by combining personal introduction ('Mam na imię Marek') with a core grammar point (1st person singular verb conjugation). It directly reflects the proficiency description of being able to fill in personal details. The task is unambiguous, well-contextualized, and follows all major guidelines. The minor format deviation in `correctAnswer` (string vs. array) is negligible given the superior quality of the linguistic task.                                |

|          12 | Llama 4         | Multiple Choice |       3 |      0.55 | This candidate fails on a critical requirement for a good multiple-choice question: determinism. The question asks for a preferred activity in a park, but multiple options are plausible. Both 'czytać książkę' (reading a book) and the marked answer 'jechać na rowerze' (riding a bike) are very common and contextually appropriate. This ambiguity makes it a poorly designed test item.                                                                                                                                                                            |
|          12 | Llama 4         | Fill Blank      |      10 |      1.62 | Excellent task. It correctly tests the fundamental A1 verb 'jestem' in the context of providing personal details. The sentence is natural, the answer is unambiguous, and it fully adheres to all instructions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
|          12 | Mistral Large 3 | Multiple Choice |       5 |      4.43 | The linguistic task itself, testing 1st person singular verb conjugation, is appropriate for A1. However, the candidate fails to follow a strict negative constraint: The 'question' field includes an instruction ('Wybierz poprawną formę czasownika:'), which was explicitly forbidden by guideline #9. This is a significant deviation from the instructions.                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
|          12 | Mistral Large 3 | Fill Blank      |      10 |      1.45 | Excellent task. It's grammatically correct, natural, and perfectly aligned with the A1 level by testing a fundamental verb ('jestem') in the context of personal introductions, as mentioned in the proficiency description. The answer is unambiguous.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
|          12 | Qwen 3 Max      | Multiple Choice |       8 |      2.84 | A good task that tests verb tense recognition based on a time marker ('Wczoraj'). The level is high A1 or borderline A2, as past tense can be complex, but the choice is made simple and clear. The task adheres to all guidelines except for the minor format inconsistency of `correctAnswer` being a string rather than an array.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
|          12 | Qwen 3 Max      | Fill Blank      |      10 |      4.13 | Excellent task. It directly tests vocabulary ('pocztówkę') related to the A1 writing skill of 'writing a short, simple postcard'. The task correctly requires the accusative case, making it a good test of both vocabulary and basic grammar for the level. The answer is unambiguous.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
|          13 | GPT-5.2         | Multiple Choice |       9 |     24.49 | This is a high-quality task. The question is grammatically correct, level-appropriate for A1, and tests a fundamental concept (prepositions with cities). It successfully follows nearly all instructions, including the crucial one of not adding extra instructions to the question. The only minor deviation is that the `correctAnswer` field is a string instead of an array, which was a subtle point in the prompt.                                                                                                                                                |
|          13 | GPT-5.2         | Fill Blank      |       9 |      2.28 | The task is excellent and directly relates to the A1 level description of writing a postcard ('Pozdrawiam... z...'). It tests a key grammatical point (pronoun case). However, it loses one point for slight ambiguity. While 'Cię' (informal you) is the most common and expected answer for an A1 learner, 'was' (formal/plural you) would also be grammatically correct, which slightly violates the strict 'only one correct answer' rule.                                                                                                                            |
|          13 | Gemini 3 Flash  | Multiple Choice |       9 |      1.26 | This is another high-quality task, very similar to Candidate 1. It correctly identifies a core A1 grammar point (prepositions) and presents it in a clear, simple sentence without any extraneous instructions. It fully meets the level and context requirements. Like Candidate 1, its only minor imperfection is providing the `correctAnswer` as a string rather than an array as suggested in the prompt's detailed description.                                                                                                                                     |
|          13 | Gemini 3 Flash  | Fill Blank      |      10 |      1.28 | This is an excellent, unambiguous A1 task. It combines two core A1 skills: stating one's name and stating where one lives. It correctly tests the conjugation of the essential verb 'mieszkać' (to live). The task is perfectly aligned with the level's focus on personal details and follows all instructions flawlessly.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
|          13 | Llama 4         | Multiple Choice |      10 |      0.48 | This is an excellent response that adheres to all instructions perfectly. The task tests a core A1 grammar point (verb 'mieć' for age) in a natural context. It correctly omits any instructions from the question, provides four clear options, and uses the specified JSON format, including the `correctAnswer` as an array. While the question consists of two short sentences, they form a single cohesive context for the blank, which is a perfectly acceptable and common format that fully respects the spirit of the instruction.                               |
|          13 | Llama 4         | Fill Blank      |      10 |      1.36 | This is an exemplary A1 task. It tests one of the most fundamental phrases a learner acquires ('Mam na imię...'). The task is perfectly deterministic with only one correct answer ('imię') and directly corresponds to the level description's mention of filling in forms with personal details. The format is correct and the task is clear.                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
|          13 | Mistral Large 3 | Multiple Choice |       6 |      2.27 | The core task (verb conjugation) is appropriate for A1. However, the candidate failed to follow a strict guideline by including an instruction in the target language ('Wybierz poprawną formę czasownika:') within the 'question' field. The prompt explicitly stated 'Do not include any instructions for the task'. This violation significantly lowers the score, despite the otherwise decent content and correct JSON format.                                                                                                                                       |
|          13 | Mistral Large 3 | Fill Blank      |      10 |      1.45 | This is a perfect A1 task. The sentence 'Mam na imię Anna i ____ z Polski' is a fundamental introductory phrase. The answer 'jestem' is unambiguous and tests the core verb 'to be'. It aligns perfectly with the A1 skill of providing personal details, as mentioned in the level description.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
|          13 | Qwen 3 Max      | Multiple Choice |       7 |      5.21 | This candidate shows excellent conceptual understanding by creating a task that directly relates to the 'fill in forms' part of the A1 proficiency description. The task is clever and highly relevant. However, like Candidate 2, it violates the strict rule against including instructions ('Wpisz swoje imię i nazwisko w formularzu:'). Because the task's concept is so well-aligned with the prompt's core requirement, it scores slightly higher than Candidate 2, but the rule violation is still a major flaw.                                                  |
|          13 | Qwen 3 Max      | Fill Blank      |       7 |      3.31 | The task is relevant to the postcard theme in the level description. However, it fails on the strict guideline to 'avoid ambiguity' and have 'only one correct answer'. Besides the correct answer 'kartę pocztową', the synonym 'pocztówkę' is also a perfectly valid and common word that fits the blank, creating two possible correct answers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
|          14 | GPT-5.2         | Multiple Choice |      10 |     19.1  | This is an excellent task that perfectly aligns with all instructions. It directly tests a skill mentioned in the A1 proficiency description ('fill in forms'). The question tests a fundamental grammar point (nominative case) in a clear, unambiguous context. The vocabulary is appropriate for A1, and the distractors are well-chosen grammatical variations of the same root word. The JSON is valid and follows the specified structure.                                                                                                                          |
|          14 | GPT-5.2         | Fill Blank      |       8 |      1.29 | This is a solid A1 task testing a core verb ('mieszkać') and personal information. However, the sentence structure itself is slightly ambiguous, as another common verb like 'pracuję' (I work) could also fit the blank. The task's unambiguity relies entirely on the English hint '(live)' rather than a tightly constrained sentence context.                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
|          14 | Gemini 3 Flash  | Multiple Choice |       7 |      1.55 | The task has excellent context and vocabulary directly related to the A1 skill of filling in forms. However, it explicitly violates the guideline that 'The task must consist of a single sentence' by using two sentences. The first sentence also acts as a soft instruction ('Proszę wypełnić formularz.'), which is borderline. Additionally, the 'correctAnswer' field uses a string instead of an array, a minor format deviation from the prompt's example.                                                                                                        |
|          14 | Gemini 3 Flash  | Fill Blank      |       9 |      1    | An excellent task testing the most fundamental Polish verb, 'być' (to be), in a personal information context. It aligns perfectly with the A1 level. It loses one point because the sentence could plausibly be completed with 'pochodzę' (I come from), making it reliant on the English hint '(am)' for disambiguation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
|          14 | Llama 4         | Multiple Choice |       9 |      2.03 | This is a very well-designed task. It tests vocabulary in a clear context, and all options are grammatically parallel (all are nouns in the locative case), which effectively isolates the vocabulary knowledge being tested. The JSON format is perfect, including the use of an array for the 'correctAnswer'. The only minor drawback is that the context (student life), while valid for A1, is less directly related to the specific skill description ('filling forms') than other candidates, but it fully adheres to the prompt's guidelines.                     |
|          14 | Llama 4         | Fill Blank      |      10 |      1.22 | This is an exemplary task. It tests a fundamental, high-frequency idiom ('mieć na imię') that is essential for A1 learners. The key strength is its perfect lack of ambiguity; 'imię' is the only word that can grammatically and idiomatically complete the sentence, making the English hint a confirmation rather than a necessary clue. It perfectly follows all instructions.                                                                                                                                                                                        |
|          14 | Mistral Large 3 | Multiple Choice |       6 |      2.23 | The candidate fails to follow a key negative constraint by including an explicit instruction ('Wybierz poprawne słowo:') in the 'question' field, which was forbidden. While the grammar point (gender agreement) is appropriate for A1, the task's relevance to the specified writing skill ('filling forms' or 'writing postcards') is low. The JSON format is correct.                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
|          14 | Mistral Large 3 | Fill Blank      |       8 |      1.58 | This is a good A1-level question, very similar to Candidate 1. It correctly tests a fundamental verb in the context of a personal introduction. The score is slightly reduced because, like Candidate 1, the sentence allows for other logical answers (e.g., 'pracuję' - I work), making it fully dependent on the English hint for its single correct answer.                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
|          14 | Qwen 3 Max      | Multiple Choice |       7 |      3.17 | The task context (filling a form) is perfectly aligned with the prompt. However, the task design is flawed from a pedagogical standpoint. The correct option is in the locative case ('formularzu'), while the distractors are in the nominative case. This conflates a vocabulary test with a grammar test, which can be confusing for an A1 learner. A better design would have all options in the same grammatical case. The 'correctAnswer' field uses a string instead of an array, a minor deviation from the prompt's example.                                     |
|          14 | Qwen 3 Max      | Fill Blank      |       7 |      3.7  | While the task cleverly uses the 'postcard' theme from the level description, it tests grammar (past tense, accusative case) and vocabulary ('nadmorskiego kurortu') that are generally considered high-A1 or even A2. The core of A1 focuses on the present tense and more basic vocabulary. The sentence is also not inherently unambiguous without the hint.                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
|          15 | GPT-5.2         | Multiple Choice |       9 |     20.76 | A very strong task that correctly tests A1 grammar (genitive case) within the specified context of filling out a form. It follows almost all guidelines, with the only minor issue being the `correctAnswer` field not being an array, which is understandable given the ambiguous instruction. The task is clear, level-appropriate, and directly relevant to the prompt's writing skill requirement.                                                                                                                                                                    |
|          15 | GPT-5.2         | Fill Blank      |       9 |      2.07 | The task is excellent for the A1 level, testing the core verb 'mieszkać' (to live) in a personal information context. It's grammatically sound, natural, and has a single, unambiguous answer. It perfectly aligns with the required proficiency level and follows all formatting rules.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
|          15 | Gemini 3 Flash  | Multiple Choice |      10 |      1.56 | An excellent and creative interpretation of the prompt. The task perfectly simulates the A1 writing skill of filling in a form by testing relevant vocabulary ('nazwisko'). The two-sentence structure effectively sets the context without being a distracting meta-instruction. It is highly natural, deterministic, and precisely aligned with both the CEFR level and the specific guidelines. This is a model answer.                                                                                                                                                |
|          15 | Gemini 3 Flash  | Fill Blank      |       9 |      1.28 | A very strong candidate that tests the essential A1 fixed phrase 'mieć na imię' (to be named). This is a crucial piece of vocabulary for introductions. The answer is deterministic and the context is highly relevant. It's an effective way to check for knowledge of key lexical chunks.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

It includes explicit instructions in the question string and uses a format with the infinitive in parentheses, which was not requested. Furthermore, it completely disregards the required context of forms or postcards. The task is fundamentally flawed in its execution.                                                                                                                                                                       |

The context of stating one's origin is a cornerstone of A1 curriculum. The task adheres to all instructions flawlessly and represents an ideal fill-in-the-blank question for this level.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
|          15 | Mistral Large 3 | Multiple Choice |       3 |      2.3  | This candidate fails on several critical points. Most importantly, the question is ambiguous and allows for multiple correct answers ('idę', 'idziemy') as no subject is provided, violating the determinism rule. It also incorrectly includes instructions ('Wybierz poprawną formę czasownika:') within the question string and fails to adhere to the specified context of filling a form or writing a postcard.                                                                                                                                                      |
|          15 | Mistral Large 3 | Fill Blank      |       3 |      1.66 | This candidate fails on a critical instruction: providing a task with a deterministic answer. The question 'mam na imię ____ (name)' can be completed with any name, making it an open-ended prompt rather than a language knowledge test. This violates guideline #7 ('the missing word/phrase must have only one correct answer') and results in a poor assessment item.                                                                                                                                                                                                |

However, the candidate completely ignored the crucial instruction to create a task related to the specified writing skills (filling forms, writing postcards), making it only partially compliant with the prompt.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
|          15 | Qwen 3 Max      | Fill Blank      |      10 |      3.21 | An outstanding candidate. It cleverly and directly incorporates the A1 level description ('write a simple postcard') into the task. The question tests both relevant vocabulary ('pocztówka') and a key A1 grammatical concept (the accusative case), making it a well-rounded and level-appropriate question with a unique, unambiguous answer.                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

|           1 | GPT-5.2         | Multiple Choice |      10 |     23.15 | The candidate perfectly adheres to all instructions. The generated JSON is valid and uses the correct schema. The task tests the use of a relative pronoun with a preposition ('w którym'), a grammatical point highly appropriate for the B2 level. The context is realistic, and the options provide clear, grammatically distinct distractors, ensuring a single correct answer. It successfully avoids including instructions in the question field.                                                                                  |
|           1 | GPT-5.2         | Fill Blank      |       8 |      1.27 | The task is well-suited for the B2 level, using relevant professional vocabulary ('raport', 'strategia', 'ryzyko') and a correct grammatical structure. The sentence is natural and the format is correct. However, it violates the 'only one correct answer' guideline. While 'ocenić' (to assess) is a very good fit, the verb 'oszacować' (to estimate) is an equally valid and common alternative in this context, making the answer not strictly deterministic.                                                                      |
|           1 | Gemini 3 Flash  | Multiple Choice |       6 |      1.62 | The candidate follows all formatting and structural instructions perfectly, resulting in a valid and correctly structured JSON. However, the linguistic task itself is not appropriate for the B2 level. It tests basic subject-verb agreement ('autor podtrzymuje'), which is an A2/B1 skill. Despite the B2-level vocabulary in the sentence, the core challenge is far too simple for the target proficiency, making the task ineffective as a B2 assessment.                                                                          |
|           1 | Gemini 3 Flash  | Fill Blank      |       9 |      1.49 | This is a high-quality task that may even touch C1 level. It uses advanced vocabulary ('pomimo licznych przeszkód', 'zarząd', 'kompromis') and complex grammar ('pomimo' + genitive, dative subject with 'udało się'). The collocation 'wypracować kompromis' is excellent. The only minor flaw is that 'osiągnąć kompromis' (to reach a compromise) is an equally perfect and common alternative, meaning the task is not strictly deterministic as per the instructions. Otherwise, it is an exemplary task.                            |
|           1 | Llama 4         | Multiple Choice |       2 |      1.41 | This candidate fails significantly on formatting requirements. The JSON schema is incorrect, using 'correct' with an index instead of 'correctAnswer' with the word, and adding an extraneous 'format' field. It also violates the instruction to omit instructions from the question by including 'Wybierz odpowiednią formę czasownika w zdaniu:'. While the grammatical task (conditional mood) is level-appropriate, the failure to follow fundamental output instructions is a major flaw.                                           |
|           1 | Llama 4         | Fill Blank      |       1 |      1.02 | This candidate fails on all criteria. The JSON format is incorrect, nested within an extra layer. It fails to include the required English translation of the missing word. The task itself is illogical, as one cannot 'read' ('czytać') movies. The provided answers are also nonsensical ('czytać książki' would result in a repetition). Finally, the vocabulary and sentence structure are at an A1/A2 level, far below the requested B2 proficiency.                                                                                |
|           1 | Mistral Large 3 | Multiple Choice |       3 |      3.13 | The candidate fails on several key guidelines. It includes instructions ('Które słowo najlepiej pasuje do zdania:') within the 'question' field, violating a specific rule. More importantly, the task is not deterministic; multiple options ('filiżance', 'kubku', 'szklance') are plausible for drinking tea, making the question ambiguous and based on preference rather than a clear linguistic rule. The level is closer to B1 than B2.                                                                                            |
|           1 | Mistral Large 3 | Fill Blank      |       3 |      2.34 | This task is fundamentally flawed because the missing verb's form depends on a subject that is not provided in the sentence. While the candidate provided 'zdecydowaliśmy' (we decided), other forms like 'zdecydowałem się' (I, male, decided), 'zdecydowałaś się' (you, female, decided), or 'zdecydowali się' (they decided) are equally possible. This violates the 'only one correct answer' and 'avoid ambiguity' rules. The difficulty level is closer to B1 than B2.                                                              |

The task targets B2-level vocabulary ('bagatelizował') within a context that requires nuanced understanding. The contrast in the sentence ('zamiast je poważnie rozważyć') makes the correct answer clear and deterministic, while the distractors are plausible but incorrect. It correctly omits any instructions from the question.                                                                                                            |

The sentence is grammatically correct and natural. The answer 'wyrazić' is the most common and fitting choice. While another verb like 'przedstawić' (to present) could also fit, 'wyrazić' is the strongest choice, making the ambiguity minimal.                                                    |
|           2 | GPT-5.2         | Multiple Choice |       8 |     16.32 | The candidate produced a valid JSON and followed most instructions. The task, which tests the subjunctive mood in a passive voice construction ('aby... zostały wprowadzone'), is grammatically correct and perfectly aligned with the B2 level. The context is appropriate. The only minor flaw is that the prompt requested the 'correctAnswer' in an array, and a string was provided, but this is a negligible deviation given the prompt's own ambiguity. The question does not contain any extra instructions, which is good.       |
|           2 | GPT-5.2         | Fill Blank      |       6 |      1.49 | The task tests an excellent B2-level grammar point (past unreal conditional) with a natural sentence. However, it fails to follow the core 'fill-in-the-blank' format instruction. Instead of leaving a blank within the sentence, it presents a complete sentence and then separately shows the phrase that was supposed to be in the blank, which is a major structural error.                                                                                                                                                          |
|           2 | Gemini 3 Flash  | Multiple Choice |      10 |      1.54 | This is an outstanding candidate that perfectly meets all requirements. The JSON is well-formatted and adheres to the instructions, including the crucial rule of not adding extra text to the question. The task itself is an excellent B2-level vocabulary question, requiring the user to distinguish between semantically similar verbs in a formal, complex sentence. The vocabulary and context ('autor raportu', 'słuszność strategii') align perfectly with the B2 proficiency description of writing reports and giving reasons. |
|           2 | Gemini 3 Flash  | Fill Blank      |       8 |      1.41 | A very strong B2-level task that appropriately tests grammar ('udało się + infinitive') and vocabulary (collocation). The context is natural and the sentence uses a B2-level structure ('Mimo...'). The score is slightly reduced because it is not fully deterministic; it provides 'osiągnąć' as the sole answer, while 'zrealizować' is another equally valid and common alternative that should have been included in the answer array.                                                                                              |
|           2 | Llama 4         | Multiple Choice |       5 |      1.16 | The linguistic content of the task (testing conditional mood) is appropriate for the B2 level and the context fits the prompt. However, the candidate failed to adhere to several key formatting guidelines. The JSON schema is incorrect, using 'correct: 0' instead of 'correctAnswer: "napisałbym"'. It also incorrectly includes instructions within the 'question' field ('Wybierz odpowiednią formę...') and provides the base verb in parentheses, which also counts as an instruction.                                            |
|           2 | Llama 4         | Fill Blank      |       9 |      2.21 | An excellent task that aligns perfectly with the B2 proficiency description (writing an essay). The context is relevant, and the vocabulary is appropriate. Although it violates the conflicting guideline for a single deterministic answer, it correctly handles the linguistic reality by providing an array of valid synonyms, making it a high-quality, natural language question.                                                                                                                                                   |
|           2 | Mistral Large 3 | Multiple Choice |       2 |      3.42 | This candidate fails on several critical points. Firstly, it violates the rule to not include instructions in the question field ('Wybierz odpowiednią formę czasownika...'). Secondly, and more importantly, the task is grammatically flawed. For the sentence 'Gdybyś _______ wcześniej...', the correct verb form would be 'przyjechał', which is not provided as an option. The provided 'correctAnswer' ('przyjechałbyś') is incorrect in this specific grammatical context, making the entire task invalid.                        |

The sentence structure is appropriate for the level, the answer is deterministic, and all formatting and content instructions have been followed perfectly.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
|           2 | Qwen 3 Max      | Multiple Choice |       6 |      5.33 | The candidate followed the formatting instructions perfectly, providing a clean and valid JSON. The sentence is grammatically correct. However, the difficulty of the task is below the requested B2 level. It tests basic gender agreement for past tense verbs ('drzewo' -> 'rozpaliło się'), which is typically a B1 or even A2 concept. Furthermore, two of the distractors rely on a simple spelling error (missing diacritic), which weakens the quality of the question for a B2 assessment.                                       |
|           2 | Qwen 3 Max      | Fill Blank      |       7 |      4.19 | The task is grammatically correct and follows the required format. However, the linguistic concept being tested (past imperfective aspect of the common verb 'czytać') is more characteristic of a B1 level. The task lacks the complexity and nuance expected for a B2 learner.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
|           3 | GPT-5.2         | Multiple Choice |       8 |      1.99 | The task is excellent, testing B2-level vocabulary (`zweryfikować`) in a highly relevant professional context (writing a report), which aligns perfectly with the prompt's proficiency description. The distractors are well-chosen. The only flaw is that the `correctAnswer` field is a string instead of an array, which deviates from the specified JSON format.                                                                                                                                                                      |
|           3 | GPT-5.2         | Fill Blank      |      10 |     17.7  | Excellent. The task tests a key B2-level fixed phrase ('biorąc pod uwagę') within a formal context appropriate for the level. The use of a participial clause is a good indicator of B2+ proficiency. The answer is unambiguous, and all formatting instructions were followed perfectly.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
|           3 | Gemini 3 Flash  | Multiple Choice |       8 |      1.36 | An excellent, high-quality task that tests knowledge of advanced collocations (`przemawiać za czymś`) in a formal context that is perfectly aligned with the B2 writing skills description. The distractors are very effective. Its only flaw is the formatting of the `correctAnswer` as a string instead of an array, which deviates from the strict guideline.                                                                                                                                                                         |
|           3 | Gemini 3 Flash  | Fill Blank      |      10 |      1.27 | Excellent. This is a perfect B2-level task. It tests both advanced grammar (the impersonal structure 'udało się' with a dative subject) and formal vocabulary/collocations ('osiągnąć porozumienie'). The provided English hint '(reach)' makes the answer 'osiągnąć' uniquely correct over other synonyms. All instructions were followed precisely.                                                                                                                                                                                     |
|           3 | Llama 4         | Multiple Choice |       3 |      3.39 | This candidate fails to produce a valid language task. The question is a test of real-world logic, not a linguistic skill. The answer is not deterministic, as multiple options are logically plausible, violating a core guideline. Although the JSON format is correct, the content of the task is fundamentally flawed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
|           3 | Llama 4         | Fill Blank      |       1 |      0.98 | Very poor. This candidate fails on multiple critical requirements. The JSON format is incorrect and does not match the specified schema. The task level is A1/A2, far below the requested B2. The sentence construction is logically flawed, and it omits the required English translation of the missing word.                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
|           3 | Mistral Large 3 | Multiple Choice |       5 |      3.45 | While the task tests a valid B2 grammar point (conditional mood) and uses the correct JSON format, it violates a key guideline by including instructions ('Wybierz odpowiednią formę czasownika...') within the 'question' field. The prompt explicitly forbids including instructions. The context is also less sophisticated than ideal for the specified level.                                                                                                                                                                        |
|           3 | Mistral Large 3 | Fill Blank      |       9 |      2.17 | Very good. The task uses appropriate B2-level business vocabulary and context. The sentence is natural and grammatically correct. The only minor flaw is that a very common synonym ('zaprezentował') could also fit, which slightly reduces the determinism requested by the prompt, though 'przedstawił' is an excellent choice.                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
|           3 | Qwen 3 Max      | Multiple Choice |       7 |      5.3  | A solid task that correctly tests knowledge of parts of speech in an appropriate B2 context (job interview). The answer is deterministic and the sentence is natural. It loses points because the difficulty is on the lower end of B2, and it uses a string for `correctAnswer` instead of an array, failing to strictly follow the specified format.                                                                                                                                                                                    |
|           3 | Qwen 3 Max      | Fill Blank      |       4 |      4.07 | Poor. Although the task is grammatically correct and follows the JSON format, it completely misses the target proficiency level. The vocabulary, grammar (present tense of a common verb), and context (daily routine) are characteristic of an A2 or low B1 level, not B2.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
|           4 | GPT-5.2         | Multiple Choice |       9 |     15.78 | A very well-constructed, level-appropriate task that correctly tests the use of contrasting conjunctions in a formal writing context (a report). It adheres to all major instructions, including the 'no instructions' and 'single sentence' rules. The task is deterministic and the vocabulary is suitable for the B2 level.                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
|           4 | GPT-5.2         | Fill Blank      |      10 |     16.67 | Excellent candidate. The task correctly tests a key B2 grammar point: the use of a relative pronoun ('który') in the genitive case ('którego') required by the negated impersonal construction 'nie da się'. The answer is deterministic, the sentence is natural and complex, and the context of a discussion is appropriate for the level. It follows all instructions perfectly.                                                                                                                                                       |
|           4 | Gemini 3 Flash  | Multiple Choice |       6 |      1.93 | The linguistic quality of this task is excellent; it tests a sophisticated conjunction ('niemniej jednak') in a perfect B2 essay-writing context. However, the score is significantly reduced because it completely ignores the strict guideline to not include any instructions in the 'question' field. The inclusion of the preamble makes the format incorrect despite the high quality of the core language test.                                                                                                                    |
|           4 | Gemini 3 Flash  | Fill Blank      |       8 |      1.23 | This candidate presents an excellent B2-level task, testing advanced vocabulary and collocation ('wypracować porozumienie') in a formal context. The sentence structure is also suitably complex. However, like Candidate 2, it fails on the determinism rule by providing only one possible answer. The verb 'osiągnąć' (to reach/achieve) is an equally valid and common alternative that should have been included in the 'correctAnswer' array.                                                                                       |
|           4 | Llama 4         | Multiple Choice |       2 |      1.83 | This task is fundamentally flawed because it is not deterministic. All four options are grammatically and semantically plausible; a report on a trip could focus on any of the topics listed. This violates the crucial guideline to have only one clear, correct answer, making the question a test of subjective preference rather than language skill.                                                                                                                                                                                 |
|           4 | Llama 4         | Fill Blank      |       8 |      1.41 | This is a solid candidate that correctly follows all instructions. It tests a relevant B1/B2 business vocabulary collocation ('rozszerzyć działalność') and implicitly requires correct past tense conjugation. The answer is deterministic, and the context is appropriate. While not as grammatically challenging as Candidate 1, it's a well-constructed and suitable task.                                                                                                                                                            |
|           4 | Mistral Large 3 | Multiple Choice |       4 |      3.62 | The candidate fails on two key points. Firstly, it violates the explicit instruction not to include instructions in the 'question' field ('Które słowo najlepiej pasuje...'). Secondly, the grammatical point tested (aspect and the use of 'żeby' + infinitive) is more appropriate for a B1 level than the specified B2 writing proficiency, which focuses on more complex text construction.                                                                                                                                           |
|           4 | Mistral Large 3 | Fill Blank      |       7 |      1.74 | A good task that tests the preposition 'mimo' with the genitive case, which is appropriate for the B1/B2 level. However, it fails to be fully deterministic as instructed. The word 'pomimo' is an equally correct and common answer that should have been included in the 'correctAnswer' array. This oversight violates the guideline regarding multiple correct answers.                                                                                                                                                               |
|           4 | Qwen 3 Max      | Multiple Choice |      10 |      8.06 | This is an excellent and challenging B2/C1 level vocabulary task. It tests the nuanced difference between abstract nouns in a professional context, which is highly relevant to the B2 writing description. It follows all structural guidelines correctly. The options are well-designed to test collocation and precise word choice, making it a high-quality, deterministic question.                                                                                                                                                  |
|           4 | Qwen 3 Max      | Fill Blank      |       5 |      6.11 | While the format is correct and the sentence is grammatically sound, the task completely misses the specified B2 proficiency level. Conjugating a regular verb in the past tense ('pracowaliśmy') is a fundamental A2/B1 skill. A B2 learner would find this task trivial, so it fails to test a key skill for the target level.                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
|           5 | GPT-5.2         | Multiple Choice |       7 |     16.94 | The task is linguistically sound and level-appropriate, testing the use of conjunctions at a B2 level. However, it fails to follow the output format instructions strictly. It includes an extra, non-requested field 'englishTranslation', which also violates the guideline 'Do not translate any parts of the sentence in English'. The value for 'correctAnswer' is a string, while the instructions hinted at an array format.                                                                                                       |

The vocabulary ('raport', 'kierownictwo', 'strategia') and the context of presenting arguments in a report align perfectly with the user's proficiency description. The use of 'aby' + infinitive is appropriate. 'Przekonać' is the most suitable verb, making the answer deterministic in this formal context.                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
|           5 | Gemini 3 Flash  | Multiple Choice |      10 |      1.48 | An exemplary response that follows all instructions perfectly. The task is a well-designed vocabulary question testing nuanced word choice ('zwięzły') in a formal context, which is highly appropriate for the B2 level. The question is a single, unadorned sentence, the options are excellent distractors, and the JSON format is correct. It effectively tests a skill needed for clear and detailed writing.                                                                                                                        |
|           5 | Gemini 3 Flash  | Fill Blank      |      10 |      1.08 | This is an exemplary B2-level task. It uses advanced vocabulary ('liczne trudności', 'zamierzony cel') and structures ('Pomimo' + genitive, 'zdołać' + infinitive) relevant to formal and professional contexts. The collocation 'osiągnąć cel' (to achieve a goal) is very strong, making 'osiągnąć' the single best choice and fulfilling all instructions perfectly.                                                                                                                                                                   |
|           5 | Llama 4         | Multiple Choice |       4 |      1.22 | While the linguistic task itself (testing the conditional mood) is appropriate for the B2 level, the candidate failed to follow multiple critical formatting instructions. It included instructions in the 'question' field, used an incorrect key ('correct' instead of 'correctAnswer'), provided the answer as an index instead of the string, and included a non-requested 'translation' field. These are significant deviations from the prompt's requirements.                                                                      |
|           5 | Llama 4         | Fill Blank      |       5 |      1.31 | The task fails the 'only one correct answer' guideline, as 'podróżowała' is a valid and common alternative to 'jeździła'. While testing the imperfective aspect for past repeated actions is a key B1/B2 skill, the ambiguity makes it a weak question for this format.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
|           5 | Mistral Large 3 | Multiple Choice |       6 |      4.99 | This candidate failed on two key instructions. First, the 'question' field includes instructions ('Które słowo poprawnie uzupełnia zdanie:'), which was explicitly forbidden. Second, the task itself, testing the collocation 'iść na spacer', is more appropriate for a B1 level rather than B2, as it's a very common phrase. The distractors are plausible but the core task lacks the complexity expected at the B2 level.                                                                                                           |
|           5 | Mistral Large 3 | Fill Blank      |       4 |      2.1  | This task violates the strict guideline of having only one correct answer. Both 'pojechać' (to go by vehicle) and 'pójść' (to go on foot) are equally valid and common answers depending on the nature of the trip, creating ambiguity. The vocabulary and grammar are more suited for a B1 level than a B2 level.                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

The question is a single sentence without any added instructions. The task tests the subjunctive mood ('abyśmy zakończyli'), a key grammatical point for the B2 level. The context is relevant, and the distractors are well-chosen to test common learner errors. The JSON format is correct.                                                                                                                                                                  |

The answer 'zrobiło' is uniquely correct due to the fixed phrase and grammatical agreement. The context is relevant, though slightly less complex than other top candidates.                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

However, it violates a key guideline by providing English translations for the options. Guideline 7 states, 'Do not translate any parts of the sentence in English,' and Guideline 3 suggests translating only 'necessary parts,' which would not include the options themselves. This significantly lowers the task's difficulty, as the user can solve it by understanding English rather than knowing the Polish vocabulary.                              |

The task is perfectly aligned with the B2 level, using relevant vocabulary ('podkreśliłem', 'znacząco', 'efektywność') within a professional context (writing a report) that matches the proficiency description. The answer is deterministic and the sentence is grammatically sound and natural. It correctly tests the collocation 'wpłynąć na'.                                                                                                                                                                  |

The context (writing a report on environmental issues) and the grammar point (verb form in a relative clause) are ideal. The question is clear, the options are effective distractors, and it follows all major guidelines. The use of a string for `correctAnswer` instead of an array is a minuscule deviation from the prompt's example but is acceptable given the overall excellence and adherence to all other rules.                |
|           6 | Gemini 3 Flash  | Fill Blank      |       6 |      1.23 | The task features excellent B2-level vocabulary and a relevant context (negotiations). However, it fails on the critical guideline of having only one correct answer. In Polish, one can 'osiągnąć porozumienie' (achieve an agreement), 'zawrzeć porozumienie' (conclude an agreement), or 'dojść do porozumienia' (arrive at an agreement). All are common and correct, making the question ambiguous for a fill-in-the-blank format.                                                                                                   |

The context of writing an essay and presenting arguments directly mirrors the user's proficiency description. The vocabulary ('esej', 'argumenty za i przeciw') and complex sentence structure are highly appropriate. The answer is deterministic and all guidelines are followed flawlessly.                                                                                                                                                      |

However, it explicitly violates Guideline 9 ('Do not include any instructions for the task') by adding 'Wybierz odpowiednią formę czasownika, aby poprawnie uzupełnić zdanie:' to the question field. The core task is good, but the inclusion of instructions is a direct failure to follow the prompt.                                                                                                                                          |

The JSON is valid, the task tests a crucial B2 concept (verb aspect) in a relevant context (formal reporting), and the vocabulary is level-appropriate. The options are well-chosen distractors, and the answer is deterministic. It fully aligns with the specified CEFR level description without any violations.                                                                                                                                              |

Crucially, it violates the guideline to avoid ambiguity. The correct answer depends on the speaker's gender ('nie poszedłem' for male, 'nie poszłam' for female), but only the male form is provided, making the task flawed.                                                                                                                                                                                            |

However, it fails on a critical requirement for a multiple-choice question, as stated in Guideline 8. Both 'nalega' and 'kładzie nacisk' are correct options in the given sentence, making the answer non-deterministic. This ambiguity makes the task invalid for assessment.                                                                                                                                                               |

However, like Candidate 4, it critically fails the 'only one correct answer' rule. The collocation 'osiągnąć porozumienie' is correct, but so are 'zawrzeć porozumienie' (to conclude an agreement) and 'wypracować porozumienie' (to work out an agreement), which are common and equally valid alternatives.                                                                                                                                                      |

The JSON is well-formatted, the task is grammatically correct, and the answer is deterministic. It correctly tests the genitive case with a common prepositional phrase. While the difficulty could be considered borderline B1/B2, it is a high-quality submission that meets all prompt requirements.                                                                                                                                            |

Several verbs like 'przeanalizować' (to analyze) or 'przedstawić' (to present) are equally valid alternatives to 'omówić', making the question ambiguous.                                                                                                                                                                                 |
|           7 | Mistral Large 3 | Multiple Choice |       8 |      3.04 | This is an excellent B2-level task focusing on the past conditional mood, a key grammatical structure. The distractors are well-designed. The score is reduced because it violates Guideline 9 by including instructions ('Wybierz odpowiednią formę czasownika, aby poprawnie uzupełnić zdanie:') in the question field.                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

However, the task violates the 'only one correct answer' rule, as 'pogodzenie' (reconciliation) could also fit. Additionally, the chosen answer 'zrównoważenie' is grammatically correct but sounds slightly less natural than the alternative noun 'równowaga' (which would require changing the adjective).                                                                                                                                                           |

Firstly, the level is closer to B1 than B2, testing basic past tense conjugation which should already be mastered. Secondly, it is not deterministic; 'zasiedziałam się' (I stayed too long) is another valid and contextually appropriate answer besides 'zostałam'.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

The grammar is accurate and the distractors are plausible.

However, the task's difficulty does not meet the B2 standard. While the sentence structure is complex, the question itself tests basic past tense verb conjugation for a 3rd person subject ('autor' -> 'zignorował').

It critically fails the determinism rule, as 'pójść' (to go on foot) or 'wybrać się' (to set out) are equally valid answers to 'pojechać' (to go by vehicle), making the provided single answer incomplete and the task ambiguous.                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

It provides a high-quality, nuanced vocabulary task that is perfectly suited for the B2 level, pushing towards C1. The context is formal and the sentence structure is complex. It adheres to all instructions, including the negative constraints. The only minor deviation is the 'correctAnswer' format (string vs. array), which is excusable given the ambiguity in the prompt's example.                                                                                                            |
|          10 | Qwen 3 Max      | Fill Blank      |       6 |      3.81 | Adequate. The context of clarifying one's position in an email is appropriate for B2. However, the task is not deterministic. Besides 'wyjaśnić' (clarify), other verbs like 'przedstawić' (present) or 'uzasadnić' (justify) would also fit the blank perfectly, violating a key instruction.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

However, the vocabulary choice is closer to a strong B1 level, as the correct answer is strongly implied by the context ('za opóźnienie'). The JSON output also includes an extra 'translation' key not specified in the required schema, and the 'correctAnswer' value is a string instead of an array.                                                                                                                                                          |
|          11 | GPT-5.2         | Fill Blank      |       6 |      1.16 | The task has a good B2-level context (writing a report) and vocabulary. However, it critically fails the guideline to have only one correct answer. The verb 'oceniłem' is the first-person masculine singular form, but without a specified subject, other forms like 'oceniłam' (feminine), 'oceniliśmy' (plural), or 'oceniono' (impersonal) are equally valid. This ambiguity makes the task flawed.                                                                                                                                  |
|          11 | Gemini 3 Flash  | Multiple Choice |      10 |      1.7  | This is an exemplary response that perfectly matches the B2 level and all instructions. The context (writing a formal report) is directly aligned with the CEFR description provided. The task tests nuanced, level-appropriate vocabulary by providing well-chosen, similar-sounding distractors, requiring a precise understanding of word choice. The task is well-designed and highly relevant.                                                                                                                                       |
|          11 | Gemini 3 Flash  | Fill Blank      |      10 |      1.41 | An outstanding task that perfectly targets the B2 level. It uses advanced vocabulary ('oskarżony', 'stanowczo', 'dowody') in a formal context. Crucially, it tests collocation ('wyprzeć się winy'), which ensures there is only one correct answer ('zaprzeczyć' would require a different grammatical structure). It adheres to all instructions flawlessly.                                                                                                                                                                            |
|          11 | Llama 4         | Multiple Choice |       2 |      0.65 | This candidate fundamentally misunderstands the request. It provides a general knowledge/trivia question rather than a language learning task that tests grammar or vocabulary. Furthermore, the question is flawed as it has more than one potentially correct answer (both Kraków and Toruń fit the description), violating the 'deterministic' and 'only one correct answer' rules.                                                                                                                                                    |
|          11 | Llama 4         | Fill Blank      |       6 |      1.1  | The vocabulary ('przeżyć' in the sense of 'undergo') and context are appropriate for B2. However, the task fails the 'only one correct answer' rule. The verb 'przeszła' (went through) is an equally correct and natural-sounding alternative to 'przeżyła' in this context. There is also a minor formatting error in the question ('___' instead of '____' and no space before the parenthesis).                                                                                                                                       |

However, it explicitly violates a strict guideline by including instructions ('Wybierz odpowiedni wyraz, aby poprawnie uzupełnić zdanie:') in the 'question' field, which the prompt forbade.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
|          11 | Mistral Large 3 | Fill Blank      |      10 |      2.09 | This is an excellent task that fully meets all requirements. The vocabulary ('zakupy online', 'sklepy stacjonarne') and the topic are highly relevant for a B2 level. The sentence is natural, and 'zakupy online' is the most direct and common answer, making it deterministic as requested. The format is perfect.                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
|          11 | Qwen 3 Max      | Multiple Choice |       9 |      7.21 | An excellent task. It uses a complex sentence with perfect B2-level vocabulary and context. While the core grammar point (adjective agreement) is foundational, its application within this complex structure makes it a valid check for a B2 learner. It adheres to all instructions very well, with only a minor format deviation (correctAnswer as a string, not an array).                                                                                                                                                            |
|          11 | Qwen 3 Max      | Fill Blank      |       7 |      3.97 | The task is cleverly constructed to have a single correct answer by providing context ('chciałem') that determines the grammatical person, gender, and number. However, the overall difficulty is too low for the B2 level. The vocabulary ('pójść do teatru') and grammar (simple past tense) are typically mastered at the A2 or B1 level.                                                                                                                                                                                              |
|          12 | GPT-5.2         | Multiple Choice |       6 |     23.52 | The task itself, testing the collocation `odnieść sukces`, is appropriate for the B2 level. However, the output has significant flaws. It violates guideline #7 ('Do not translate any parts of the sentence in English') by including `(English: I succeeded)`. This hint makes the task much easier and goes against the principles of a language test. It also violates guideline #9 ('Do not include any instructions'). Lastly, the `correctAnswer` field is a string, not an array as specified in the instructions.                |
|          12 | GPT-5.2         | Fill Blank      |       9 |      1.35 | Excellent candidate. The sentence structure is complex and the vocabulary ('wyniki badań', 'kryteria oceny') is appropriate for the B2 level, aligning well with the 'writing a report' context from the proficiency description. The answer 'zależą' is the most natural and common choice, making the task highly deterministic and well-designed. It correctly tests the conjugation of a key verb in a formal context.                                                                                                                |

The task is excellent, testing B2-level vocabulary (phrasal verbs like `opowiedzieć się za`) within a formal context that aligns perfectly with the level description's focus on writing reports and arguing a point of view. It strictly adheres to the crucial guidelines of having no instructions and no English translations. The only minor deviation from the instructions is that `correctAnswer` is a string rather than an array.                                                                   |

The task tests a crucial B2-level collocation ('wziąć pod uwagę'). The complex sentence structure and formal vocabulary are ideal for the level. Most importantly, the answer is completely deterministic; within the phrase '____ pod uwagę', 'wziął' is the only grammatically correct option for the subject and tense. It's an unambiguous, high-quality task.                                                                                                           |

It violates guideline #9 by including instructions. It completely fails to follow the specified JSON schema, using `"correct": 1` instead of a `"correctAnswer"` field. Most importantly, the designated correct answer (index 1, 'był') is grammatically incorrect; the right answer is 'było' (index 0).                                                                   |
|          12 | Llama 4         | Fill Blank      |       4 |      0.43 | This task is weak because it violates two guidelines. Firstly, it is not deterministic; 'przeprowadziła się' is an equally correct, and arguably more common, answer for moving house. This also means it fails the guideline to 'choose the word/phrase that is most likely to be used'. The task is ambiguous and the chosen answer is not the most idiomatic one.                                                                                                                                                                      |

The task, which tests verb aspect and reflexive pronoun usage, is grammatically sound. However, it violates guideline #9 ('Do not include any instructions') by prepending 'Które słowo najlepiej uzupełnia zdanie:' to the question. The linguistic difficulty is also borderline B1/B2, arguably a bit simple for the target level.                                                                  |

While the sentence is grammatically correct and the B2-level business context is appropriate, the blank can be filled by at least one other equally valid and common word: 'zaprezentował'. The instruction to ensure 'only one correct answer' was not followed.                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

The main weakness is that the level is closer to B1 than B2; choosing the correct conjunction for an indirect question is a core intermediate skill. The JSON format is nearly perfect, with the minor exception of `correctAnswer` being a string instead of an array.                                                                                          |

The candidate loses points for failing to provide the required English translation of the sentence.                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

However, it fails to follow a key guideline by omitting the required English translation of the missing phrase in parentheses. This is a significant deviation from the instructions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
|          13 | Mistral Large 3 | Multiple Choice |       6 |      3.79 | The linguistic task, focusing on verb aspect and reflexivity, is appropriate for the B2 level. However, the output violates two explicit guidelines: it includes instructions ('Które słowo najlepiej pasuje do zdania:') within the 'question' field, and it completely omits the required English translation of the sentence.                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

However, the verb being tested ('zdecydować się') and its simple past tense conjugation are more characteristic of a B1 level. While the sentence is grammatically acceptable, a stronger B2 task would target more complex vocabulary or grammatical structures.                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

It effectively tests the use of 'aby' + infinitive to express purpose. The only flaw is a minor but common grammatical error in the provided sentence ('długiego e-maila' should be 'długi e-mail' in the accusative case), which slightly detracts from its perfection.                                                                                                                                                    |

However, it violates two explicit guidelines by including an English translation and instructions ('(EN: Choose the best word to complete the sentence.)') within the 'question' field. The prompt stated 'Do not translate any parts of the sentence in English' and 'Do not include any instructions for the task'.                                                                                                                                                     |

The sentence is natural and the context is appropriate. However, it slightly violates the 'only one correct answer' rule, as other verbs like 'ukończyłbym' (would have completed) or 'napisałbym' (would have written) could also fit the context, even if 'skończyłbym' is the most direct translation of the hint.                                                                                                     |

The sentence is complex, uses formal vocabulary appropriate for B2 ('zrównoważony rozwój', 'zamierzony cel'), and tests the correct verb form (infinitive with correct aspect) in a dependent clause. This accurately reflects the ability to construct and understand detailed, formal text.                                                                                                                                                       |

The context is appropriate for the level. The answer is the most natural and expected choice, strongly guided by the English hint 'to reach', making it effectively deterministic and a good test of a learner's lexical knowledge.                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

Testing the basic past tense aspect distinction ('zrobiłem' vs 'robiłem') for a simple completed action is a core B1 skill. The task does not meet the required proficiency level.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

The question is highly ambiguous, allowing for numerous correct answers (e.g., 'tygodnia', 'dwóch tygodni'), which violates the determinism rule. It also fails to include the mandatory English translation of the missing word. Furthermore, the sentence's logical construction is slightly awkward, and the tested concept (genitive case after 'od') is more typical of the B1 level.                                                                                          |

A B2 task should test more complex structures or vocabulary. Additionally, it violates the guideline 'Do not include any instructions for the task' by adding 'Które słowo najlepiej uzupełnia zdanie:' to the question.                                                                                                                                                                                     |

It strictly adheres to all instructions, including the negative constraints (no instructions, no translations). The question tests a subtle but important grammatical distinction between an adjective, participles, and an adverb, using level-appropriate vocabulary ('pogardliwy') in a realistic context. The distractors are very well-chosen.                                                                                                                                                   |

The options are well-differentiated. However, it fails to strictly adhere to the output format by providing the `correctAnswer` as a string instead of an array containing a string, as specified in the instructions.                                                                                                                                                                                    |

The vocabulary 'poczynić postępy' is a sophisticated and natural collocation. While 'zrobił' could be a possible alternative, 'poczynił' is stylistically superior and more likely in this formal context, thus adhering well to the guideline of choosing the 'most likely' word.                                                                                                                                                    |

It tests knowledge of academic collocations ('przytacza argumenty'). The score is brought down by the failure to adhere to the specified JSON format for the `correctAnswer` field, which should have been an array.                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

Its main weakness is the ambiguity of the answer. 'Zwracają uwagę' (draw attention) is an equally valid and common alternative to 'wskazują' (point out), which violates the strict instruction for a single deterministic answer.                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

It tests a core grammar point effectively. Like Candidate 1, it has a minor format deviation, providing `correctAnswer` as a string instead of an array.                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

It tests a fundamental grammar point (prepositional case of location) with clear, unambiguous options. The only minor flaw is that the `correctAnswer` is a string instead of an array of strings, which deviates from the specified JSON format example.                                                                                                                                                            |

It directly relates to the A1 level description of writing a short postcard for greetings. The task tests both vocabulary ('день рождения') and a key A1 grammar point (the Instrumental case after the preposition 'с'). The sentence is natural, the answer is unambiguous, and the format is correct. It is a model example of a well-designed, level-appropriate task.                                                                                      |
|           3 | Gemini 3 Flash  | Multiple Choice |       7 |      1.41 | The task correctly targets an A1 grammar point (prepositional case) and has a relevant context. However, the phrasing 'в городе ______' is slightly ambiguous, as the appositive construction 'в городе Москва' (nominative case) is also possible in some contexts, which could confuse learners. The task is less direct than Candidate 1's. It also uses a string for the answer instead of an array.                                                                                                                              |
|           3 | Gemini 3 Flash  | Fill Blank      |       9 |      1.69 | This is a very strong candidate. The task is simple, clear, and perfectly appropriate for the A1 level, testing the fundamental introductory phrase 'Меня зовут...'. It aligns well with the 'filling in forms with personal details' part of the level description. The answer is completely unambiguous and all formatting instructions are followed correctly. While slightly more basic than Candidate 1's task, it is an excellent and highly effective question for a beginner.                                                 |
|           3 | Llama 4         | Multiple Choice |       5 |      2.41 | While the JSON format is correct, the task is not suitable for the A1 level. The use of a complex sentence with a subordinate clause ('...где есть...') and the grammar point itself (accusative animate plural) are characteristic of the A2 level or higher. It fails the core requirement of matching the specified proficiency level.                                                                                                                                                                                             |
|           3 | Llama 4         | Fill Blank      |       3 |      0.66 | The candidate fails on several key guidelines. Most importantly, it demonstrates a critical lack of accuracy by providing a grammatically incorrect word ('живу') as a correct answer; 'Я живу из Москвы' is wrong. Furthermore, the task is ambiguous, as other words like 'приехала' (arrived) could also fit, violating the 'only one correct answer' rule. The English hint '(am)' is also vague and unhelpful for eliciting the correct word 'родом'. The JSON itself is valid, but the linguistic content is deeply flawed.     |
|           3 | Mistral Large 3 | Multiple Choice |       6 |      2.01 | The task uses appropriate A1 vocabulary and has a correct JSON format (using an array for the answer). However, it fails to follow a strict guideline by including instructions ('Выберите правильное слово:') in the question. Additionally, its context is more generic and less specifically tied to the 'writing' skill description compared to other candidates.                                                                                                                                                                 |

It tests A1-level adjective-noun agreement in a very natural context, and the options are perfectly chosen. Like Candidate 1, its only minor imperfection is the `correctAnswer` format being a string instead of an array.                                                                                                                                                                  |

|           4 | GPT-5.2         | Multiple Choice |       9 |     15.16 | Excellent adherence to the prompt's core requirement. The context 'В анкете:' (In the form:) directly targets the specified A1 writing skill of filling in forms. The task itself, choosing the correct preposition of place ('в'), is a fundamental A1 concept. The only flaw is that `correctAnswer` is a string instead of an array of strings as specified in the prompt's example, which is a minor formatting deviation.                                                                                                        |
|           4 | GPT-5.2         | Fill Blank      |       9 |      1.04 | The task is excellent and highly relevant to the A1 level, directly referencing the 'postcard' example. It correctly tests the first-person singular conjugation of a key verb ('пишу'). The format is perfect. A point is deducted because 'Дорогая Анна,' is a salutation, not part of the sentence, which slightly bends the 'create one sentence' rule, even though it makes the context more naturalistic.                                                                                                                       |
|           4 | Gemini 3 Flash  | Multiple Choice |       8 |      1.44 | A very good task that is highly relevant to the prompt. The context 'Меня зовут Иван. Я живу в городе...' perfectly simulates providing personal information for a form. It tests the prepositional case, a core A1 skill. Like Candidates 1 and 3, its only weakness is a minor formatting error where `correctAnswer` is a string instead of the requested array.                                                                                                                                                                   |
|           4 | Gemini 3 Flash  | Fill Blank      |      10 |      1.77 | An exemplary response that follows all guidelines perfectly. The task tests the fundamental A1 phrase for introducing oneself ('Меня зовут'), which directly relates to the 'fill in forms with personal details' skill. The question is simple, unambiguous, level-appropriate, and correctly formatted. It is a classic and effective A1 language task.                                                                                                                                                                             |

The task tests the prepositional case, which is appropriate for A1. The context of where one lives is relevant to personal details. The sentence is slightly more complex than other candidates, but it remains well within the A1 level. Its strict adherence to all rules makes it an excellent response.                                                                                                     |
|           4 | Llama 4         | Fill Blank      |       4 |      0.33 | The task has significant flaws. The English translation for the missing word, '(am)', is inaccurate for the correct answer 'родом' (which means 'originally from' or 'by birth from'). This is highly misleading for a learner. Additionally, the word 'родом' is arguably A2 level, making the task potentially too difficult and not focused on core A1 skills. A simpler construction like 'Я из Москвы' would be more appropriate.                                                                                                |
|           4 | Mistral Large 3 | Multiple Choice |       5 |      1.88 | Fails to follow two strict guidelines. It includes instructions ('Выберите правильное слово:') within the 'question' field, which was explicitly forbidden. Furthermore, while the task is appropriate for A1 level, its context (daily routine) does not align with the specified writing skill of 'filling in forms with personal details'. The JSON format is correct, but the content misses the mark.                                                                                                                            |
|           4 | Mistral Large 3 | Fill Blank      |       2 |      2.17 | This candidate fails on several core requirements. Firstly, the JSON format is incorrect as it includes an extra 'translation' field. More importantly, the task design is fundamentally flawed. It asks for a personal name, which is not a deterministic vocabulary or grammar test item, violating the guideline that the answer must have 'only one correct answer' or be a 'deterministic' set. It's a prompt for personal information, not a language assessment task.                                                          |
|           4 | Qwen 3 Max      | Multiple Choice |       8 |      4.56 | This is a strong candidate. The task correctly tests a crucial A1 grammar point (the prepositional case of a noun after 'в'). The context 'Я живу в...' is highly relevant to providing personal details for a form. The distractors are well-chosen case variations. It loses points for not formatting the `correctAnswer` as an array, a minor deviation from the instructions.                                                                                                                                                    |
|           4 | Qwen 3 Max      | Fill Blank      |      10 |      3.32 | This is a perfect response that adheres to all instructions. The task tests both a key A1 vocabulary word ('открытка' - postcard) and a fundamental grammatical concept (the accusative case). It is unambiguous, correctly formatted, and directly relevant to the proficiency description provided in the prompt.                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
|           5 | GPT-5.2         | Multiple Choice |       8 |     29.18 | The task tests a relevant A1 grammar point (prepositions of direction). However, it violates guideline #9 by including the instructional phrase 'Как правильно:' ('What is correct:') in the question string. The format for 'correctAnswer' is a string, while the prompt ambiguously suggested an array.                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
|           5 | GPT-5.2         | Fill Blank      |       9 |      1.22 | The task is excellent and perfectly aligned with the A1 level and the 'postcard writing' context given in the prompt. It correctly tests the first-person present tense conjugation of the common verb 'писать' (to write). The JSON is valid and all instructions were followed. It's a high-quality, relevant exercise.                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
|           5 | Gemini 3 Flash  | Multiple Choice |       9 |      1.37 | This is a very strong and well-designed task. It tests a specific, important, and challenging A1 grammar point (prepositional case of a proper noun) that directly relates to the skill of filling in personal details. The options are excellent distractors. The only minor issue is that the 'correctAnswer' is a string instead of an array as suggested by the prompt.                                                                                                                                                           |
|           5 | Gemini 3 Flash  | Fill Blank      |       8 |      1.18 | This is a very good task that tests a foundational A1 phrase for introductions ('Меня зовут'). It is extremely relevant for a beginner, unambiguous, and grammatically perfect. The task adheres to all guidelines. While it represents the simpler end of the A1 spectrum, its correctness and relevance make it a strong and useful item.                                                                                                                                                                                           |
|           5 | Llama 4         | Multiple Choice |       2 |      0.51 | This task is fundamentally flawed as a language assessment. It does not test a language skill but rather a cultural stereotype or logical assumption (that a person from Russia must have a Russian city as their favorite). All options are grammatically correct, making the question non-deterministic and unfair. It completely fails the guideline that the answer must not allow for multiple interpretations.                                                                                                                  |
|           5 | Llama 4         | Fill Blank      |       8 |      1.15 | A solid and well-constructed task. It correctly tests a core A1 grammar concept: the prepositional case for location ('в городе'). The context of providing personal information is relevant to the level. The task is clear, accurate, and follows all formatting rules. While not as creative as other candidates in using the 'postcard' theme, it is a very effective and standard A1 exercise.                                                                                                                                   |
|           5 | Mistral Large 3 | Multiple Choice |      10 |      2.05 | This is an excellent task that perfectly adheres to all instructions. It tests a fundamental A1 grammar point (present tense verb conjugation) in a common daily life context. The distractors are well-chosen, and the JSON format, including the array for 'correctAnswer', is correct.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
|           5 | Mistral Large 3 | Fill Blank      |       1 |      1.34 | The generated task is grammatically incorrect. The sentence 'я ____ из России' cannot be completed with the provided correct answer 'живу'. The correct phrasing for 'I live in Russia' is 'я живу в России', and for 'I am from Russia' is 'я из России'. This fundamental error makes the task unsolvable and confusing for a learner.                                                                                                                                                                                              |
|           5 | Qwen 3 Max      | Multiple Choice |       4 |      4.58 | The task is grammatically correct, but it violates the core requirement of being deterministic with a single correct answer. All four options ('postcard', 'book', 'letter', 'package') are grammatically and semantically plausible items to send for a birthday. The question does not test a specific language skill but rather relies on guessing the intended answer, which was likely inspired too closely by the prompt's example.                                                                                             |
|           5 | Qwen 3 Max      | Fill Blank      |      10 |      4.07 | This is a perfect response. The task cleverly uses the 'postcard' theme from the proficiency description. It tests both A1 vocabulary ('открытка' - postcard) and a crucial A1 grammar point (the accusative case). The question is natural, unambiguous, and perfectly suited for the target level. All formatting and content guidelines were strictly followed.                                                                                                                                                                    |
|           6 | GPT-5.2         | Multiple Choice |      10 |     19.41 | The task perfectly aligns with the A1 level description of 'filling in forms' by using the context 'В анкете' (In the form). It tests a fundamental A1 grammar point: gender agreement of possessive pronouns ('имя' is neuter). The options are clear and well-chosen distractors. The format is valid and all instructions were followed.                                                                                                                                                                                           |
|           6 | GPT-5.2         | Fill Blank      |      10 |      1.08 | The candidate produced a perfectly formatted JSON. The task is excellent for the A1 level, directly referencing the 'writing a postcard' skill mentioned in the prompt. It tests a high-frequency verb ('писать') in the correct 1st person singular present tense form ('пишу'), which is a core A1 grammar point. The sentence is natural, and the answer is deterministic, fulfilling all guidelines.                                                                                                                              |
|           6 | Gemini 3 Flash  | Multiple Choice |      10 |      1.17 | An outstanding task that aligns perfectly with providing personal details for a form or postcard. It tests the prepositional case with 'в' to indicate location ('Я живу в Москве'), which is a crucial and fundamental concept for A1 learners. The options correctly test different cases of the same noun, making it an effective grammar check.                                                                                                                                                                                   |
|           6 | Gemini 3 Flash  | Fill Blank      |       9 |      1.67 | The candidate followed all formatting instructions correctly. The task is highly appropriate for the A1 level, testing the crucial fixed expression 'Меня зовут' (My name is). This is one of the first phrases learners acquire and is directly related to providing personal details. The sentence is natural, and the answer is deterministic. A very strong and fundamental A1 task.                                                                                                                                              |
|           6 | Llama 4         | Multiple Choice |       9 |      1.48 | A strong task that fits the 'filling in forms with personal details' context by asking for age. It correctly tests the use of cardinal numbers, an A1 topic. The JSON format is correct. The task is well-designed, although the case-based distractors might be slightly challenging for the very beginning of A1, but the correct answer is the most basic form.                                                                                                                                                                    |
|           6 | Llama 4         | Fill Blank      |       9 |      1.28 | The output is a valid JSON and follows the specified format. The task is very good for the A1 level, testing the essential preposition 'из' to indicate origin. This aligns with the 'personal details' aspect of the proficiency description. The sentence is natural and the answer is deterministic. It's a solid A1 task, though slightly less complex than tasks testing verb conjugations or noun cases.                                                                                                                        |
|           6 | Mistral Large 3 | Multiple Choice |       8 |      2.15 | A good A1-level task testing present tense verb conjugation, a core skill. However, the daily routine context ('I drink coffee every morning') is less directly tied to the specified writing skills ('filling in forms' or 'writing a postcard') compared to other candidates, making it less tailored to the prompt's specific context.                                                                                                                                                                                             |
|           6 | Mistral Large 3 | Fill Blank      |       3 |      2.15 | The JSON format is incorrect as it includes an extra, unrequested 'translation' field. More importantly, the task design is fundamentally flawed. By asking for a 'name' and providing a non-exhaustive list of examples as 'correctAnswer', it violates the crucial guideline that the answer must be deterministic. The task becomes a guessing game, not a valid language assessment.                                                                                                                                              |
|           6 | Qwen 3 Max      | Multiple Choice |      10 |      3.38 | Excellent task that directly reflects the 'writing a short, simple postcard' skill from the level description by framing the question as 'I am writing a letter to a friend...'. It tests adjective-noun gender agreement ('погода' is feminine), a key A1 concept. The options are perfect distractors and it fully meets all prompt requirements.                                                                                                                                                                                   |
|           6 | Qwen 3 Max      | Fill Blank      |      10 |      3.04 | This candidate provides a perfect response. The JSON is well-formatted. The task cleverly combines vocabulary and grammar relevant to the A1 level and the specific skill of 'writing a postcard'. It tests the noun 'открытка' (postcard) in the required accusative case ('открытку'), a key grammatical concept for beginners. The context is natural and the answer is unambiguous.                                                                                                                                               |
|           7 | GPT-5.2         | Multiple Choice |       8 |     22.62 | The task directly addresses the 'filling in forms' context, which is excellent. However, the question tests world knowledge (knowing Moscow is in Russia) rather than a specific grammatical or vocabulary point in the way a language task typically would. The JSON is valid but includes an extra 'translation' field not specified in the final structure, likely an attempt to resolve contradictory instructions in the prompt. The 'correctAnswer' format as a string is an acceptable interpretation of the ambiguous prompt. |
|           7 | GPT-5.2         | Fill Blank      |       9 |      1.48 | This is a very strong candidate that aligns perfectly with the A1 level description of 'sending holiday greetings' on a postcard. It tests a common and useful set phrase ('с днём рождения') and the instrumental case. The task is clear and natural. It loses one point because the alternative (though dated/poetic) spelling 'рожденья' is also technically possible, which slightly goes against the 'only one correct answer' guideline, although 'рождения' is the standard and expected answer at this level.                |
|           7 | Gemini 3 Flash  | Multiple Choice |      10 |      1.22 | This is a perfect response, functionally identical to Candidate 3. It creates a flawless A1 grammar task testing the prepositional case, a skill directly applicable to writing one's personal details. The task is clear, level-appropriate, and adheres to all constraints of the prompt, resulting in a high-quality educational item.                                                                                                                                                                                             |
|           7 | Gemini 3 Flash  | Fill Blank      |      10 |      1.14 | A perfect candidate. This task tests one of the most fundamental phrases an A1 learner acquires: introducing oneself. 'Меня зовут...' is a core vocabulary and grammar point. The task is simple, clear, unambiguous, and perfectly aligned with the 'personal details' competency for the A1 level. All guidelines, including JSON format and content, are met flawlessly.                                                                                                                                                           |
|           7 | Llama 4         | Multiple Choice |      10 |      1.27 | This is another excellent response. It correctly identifies a core A1 grammar point (genitive case after 'из') needed to provide personal information. The context is perfectly aligned with the proficiency description, the task is well-formed, and it follows all instructions, including the JSON structure and using an array for 'correctAnswer' as suggested in the prompt example.                                                                                                                                           |
|           7 | Llama 4         | Fill Blank      |       9 |      1.74 | A very good candidate that tests a fundamental A1 structure for stating one's origin. The sentence is correct and relevant to the 'personal details' aspect of the proficiency level. The only minor flaw is the English prompt '(am from)' for a blank that requires only the preposition 'из' (from). The verb 'am' is omitted in Russian, so the prompt is a slight over-translation for the single-word answer, which could be minimally confusing.                                                                               |
|           7 | Mistral Large 3 | Multiple Choice |       4 |      2.01 | While this is a valid and well-constructed A1 vocabulary task, it completely fails to adhere to the central requirement of the prompt: creating a task related to the writing skill of 'filling in forms with personal details'. The context of drinking coffee is unrelated to the specified proficiency description.                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
|           7 | Mistral Large 3 | Fill Blank      |       1 |      1.13 | This candidate is a complete failure. The question 'Меня зовут ____ Иван' is grammatically and logically incoherent, as it provides a name ('Иван') and then asks for another name to be inserted. The provided 'correctAnswer' ('Андрей') is completely arbitrary and makes the sentence nonsensical. The task does not test any linguistic skill and would only confuse a learner.                                                                                                                                                  |
|           7 | Qwen 3 Max      | Multiple Choice |      10 |      4.38 | This is an outstanding response. It perfectly targets the underlying grammatical knowledge (prepositional case after 'в') required for the A1 writing skill of providing personal details like an address. The task is clear, the options are excellent distractors, and it adheres flawlessly to all formatting and content instructions.                                                                                                                                                                                            |
|           7 | Qwen 3 Max      | Fill Blank      |      10 |      3.03 | An excellent candidate that perfectly fulfills all instructions. The task is directly inspired by the level description ('write a short, simple postcard') without copying it. It tests a core A1 grammar point (accusative case for a feminine noun) within a natural, unambiguous, and level-appropriate context. The formatting and content are flawless.                                                                                                                                                                          |
|           8 | GPT-5.2         | Multiple Choice |      10 |     11.6  | The candidate perfectly aligns with the prompt's requirements. The task, choosing the correct preposition for a city, is a fundamental A1 skill. Crucially, the context 'В анкете:' ('In the form:') directly targets the specified proficiency description 'fill in forms with personal details', showing a superior understanding of the instructions. The task is accurate, level-appropriate, and unambiguous.                                                                                                                    |
|           8 | GPT-5.2         | Fill Blank      |      10 |      1.59 | Excellent task that directly aligns with the A1 level description of 'writing a short, simple postcard, for example sending holiday greetings.' It tests the essential fixed phrase 'с днём рождения' and the associated instrumental case, which is appropriate for the level. The task is deterministic and follows all instructions perfectly.                                                                                                                                                                                     |
|           8 | Gemini 3 Flash  | Multiple Choice |       9 |      1.85 | The task is a fundamental A1 grammar exercise (verb conjugation) set in the context of providing personal information ('My name is... I live...'). This aligns well with the 'fill in forms' aspect of the proficiency description. The task is accurate, clear, and perfectly level-appropriate. It's a very solid and effective task, only slightly less creative in its contextual framing than the top-scoring candidates.                                                                                                        |
|           8 | Gemini 3 Flash  | Fill Blank      |       9 |      0.97 | A very good task that tests the essential A1 phrase 'Меня зовут...' (My name is...). It correctly creates a deterministic question for this structure, unlike Candidate 2. The task is clear, accurate, and relevant to the 'personal details' aspect of the A1 level. It is a textbook example of a good A1 vocabulary/grammar question.                                                                                                                                                                                             |
|           8 | Llama 4         | Multiple Choice |       9 |      0.42 | This is a strong A1 grammar task testing the dative plural case for days of the week, a useful structure for writing about routines in a letter or postcard. The task is accurate and the distractors are well-designed (other case forms). While the grammar point might be considered high-A1, it is still appropriate. The connection to the writing skill is good, though not as explicit as in candidates 1 and 3.                                                                                                               |
|           8 | Llama 4         | Fill Blank      |       8 |      0.42 | A solid A1 task testing a fundamental structure for stating one's origin ('я из...'). The topic of personal details is relevant. However, the English cue '(am from)' is slightly imprecise as it might lead learners to look for a verb, while the correct answer is a preposition ('из'). A cue of just '(from)' would have been clearer.                                                                                                                                                                                           |
|           8 | Mistral Large 3 | Multiple Choice |       9 |      1.74 | The task is a valid A1 vocabulary question about daily routines, which is relevant context for writing a simple postcard or message. The format is correct, and the options are well-chosen. It is slightly less targeted to the specific writing skills mentioned in the prompt (form-filling or postcard writing) compared to other candidates, although it's still a very good and appropriate task.                                                                                                                               |
|           8 | Mistral Large 3 | Fill Blank      |       3 |      1.42 | This candidate fundamentally misunderstands the nature of a deterministic fill-in-the-blank task. Guideline #7 ('only one correct answer') and #9 ('The answer should be deterministic') are violated. While the topic is A1, allowing any name as an answer makes it an invalid assessment of linguistic knowledge rather than a test of a specific word or grammar point.                                                                                                                                                           |
|           8 | Qwen 3 Max      | Multiple Choice |      10 |      4.07 | The candidate provided an excellent interpretation of the prompt. The contextual framing 'Я пишу письмо другу и хочу сказать:' ('I'm writing a letter to a friend and I want to say:') brilliantly connects the grammar task (verb conjugation) directly to the act of writing, which perfectly matches the proficiency description. The task is clear, accurate, and highly relevant.                                                                                                                                                |
|           8 | Qwen 3 Max      | Fill Blank      |      10 |      2.8  | Perfect execution. The task is directly inspired by the A1 skill description ('I can write a short, simple postcard'). It correctly tests both A1 vocabulary ('открытка') and a core A1 grammar point (the accusative case for a direct object). The task is unambiguous, deterministic, and adheres to all guidelines.                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
|           9 | GPT-5.2         | Multiple Choice |       8 |     16.98 | The task is excellent and tests a core A1 grammar point (prepositional case) relevant to the specified writing skill. However, the JSON format is incorrect as it includes an extra `translation` field not requested in the final schema and provides the `correctAnswer` as a string instead of an array of strings.                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
|           9 | GPT-5.2         | Fill Blank      |       8 |      1.34 | The task is well-formed, grammatically correct, and appropriate for the A1 level. It tests verbs of motion ('еду'), a key A1 topic, within a natural context of telling someone about travel plans, which fits the 'postcard' theme. The only minor issue is that the perfective future 'поеду' could also be a valid answer for a planned weekend trip, making the answer not strictly unique. However, the English hint '(am going)' strongly favors the provided answer 'еду'.                                                     |
|           9 | Gemini 3 Flash  | Multiple Choice |       9 |      1.03 | This is an excellent task that perfectly tests A1 verb conjugation in a context directly related to providing personal details. The task is clear and the distractors are well-chosen. Its only minor flaw is providing `correctAnswer` as a string instead of an array of strings.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
|           9 | Gemini 3 Flash  | Fill Blank      |      10 |      1.36 | This is a flawless execution of the instructions. The task tests one of the most fundamental phrases for an A1 learner ('Меня зовут...'). It is completely unambiguous, with 'зовут' being the only possible correct answer. The task directly relates to the 'fill in forms with personal details' aspect of the A1 level description. All formatting and content requirements from the prompt were met perfectly.                                                                                                                   |
|           9 | Llama 4         | Multiple Choice |       1 |      1.16 | The output fails on multiple critical instructions. It includes instructions and English words within the 'question' field, uses an incorrect JSON schema (`'correct': 2` instead of `correctAnswer`), and presents a confusing, multi-part question that is unnatural and poorly constructed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
|           9 | Llama 4         | Fill Blank      |       2 |      0.49 | The candidate failed on two major points. First, it did not follow the instruction to include the English translation of the missing word in the question. Second, the provided answer 'начинаю' creates a grammatically incorrect sentence: 'Я обычно начинаю на работу' is wrong. The correct construction would be 'начинаю работать' or 'начинаю работу'. The blank itself is ambiguous and could be filled with 'хожу' or 'еду', but the provided answer is incorrect.                                                           |
|           9 | Mistral Large 3 | Multiple Choice |      10 |      2.04 | The candidate provides a solid A1 vocabulary task in a common daily routine context. It flawlessly adheres to all instructions, including the JSON structure with `correctAnswer` as an array. The task is clear, accurate, and perfectly level-appropriate.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
|           9 | Mistral Large 3 | Fill Blank      |       2 |      1.37 | This task is fundamentally flawed. The resulting sentence 'Меня зовут Анна, и я живу из России' is grammatically incorrect. The verb 'живу' (I live) requires the preposition 'в' (in), not 'из' (from). To express 'I am from Russia,' no verb is used in the present tense ('Я из России'). Therefore, the blank cannot be filled with the provided answer, or any single verb, to create a correct sentence. This task would confuse a learner.                                                                                    |
|           9 | Qwen 3 Max      | Multiple Choice |       9 |      3.39 | This is a very strong candidate. The task is highly relevant as it cleverly adapts the 'postcard/letter' context from the proficiency description without copying it. The vocabulary is appropriate for A1. The only minor flaw is that `correctAnswer` is a string, not an array of strings as specified in the instructions.                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
|           9 | Qwen 3 Max      | Fill Blank      |       9 |      2.81 | This is an excellent task that directly aligns with the 'writing a postcard' context from the proficiency description. It tests a very common set phrase ('Счастливого Нового года!') and the use of the genitive case in greetings, which is a useful chunk of language for an A1 learner. The use of the English hint '(New Year)' successfully removes ambiguity. The sentence structure '...и говорю' is slightly unnatural but grammatically acceptable.                                                                         |
|          10 | GPT-5.2         | Multiple Choice |       6 |     18.72 | The candidate fails to follow several strict guidelines. It includes instructions within the 'question' field ('Какое слово подходит') and also translates them ('Which word fits'), directly violating guidelines #9 ('Do not include any instructions') and #7 ('Do not translate any parts of the sentence'). While the linguistic task itself (prepositions of motion) is appropriate for A1, these formatting errors are significant.                                                                                            |
|          10 | GPT-5.2         | Fill Blank      |       8 |      1.71 | A very good candidate that directly addresses the prompt's context of 'sending holiday greetings.' The task is level-appropriate (A1) and tests a common phrase. The grammar is correct ('счастливых' is the correct genitive plural form). The only minor weakness is that other adjectives like 'весёлых' (merry) or 'хороших' (good) could also fit, slightly violating the 'only one correct answer' rule. However, the English cue 'happy' strongly points to the intended answer.                                               |
|          10 | Gemini 3 Flash  | Multiple Choice |      10 |      1.52 | This is an excellent and well-constructed task. It adheres to all guidelines, including the negative constraints. The task of choosing the correct case for a city name directly corresponds to the A1 writing skill 'fill in forms with personal details'. It tests a fundamental A1 grammar point (prepositional case of location) using a simple, clear, and highly relevant sentence structure.                                                                                                                                   |
|          10 | Gemini 3 Flash  | Fill Blank      |      10 |      1.13 | An excellent and perfectly executed task. It tests a fundamental A1 vocabulary/grammar chunk ('Меня зовут'). The task is simple, clear, and absolutely essential for the level, aligning with the 'fill in forms with personal details' skill. It fully complies with the 'only one correct answer' guideline, as 'зовут' is the only word that fits. The format is correct and the task is highly effective.                                                                                                                         |
|          10 | Llama 4         | Multiple Choice |       8 |      0.56 | The candidate correctly identifies a core A1 grammar point (instrumental case with 'с') and follows the negative constraints about instructions and translations. However, the sentence structure ('Я живу в городе, где есть большой парк...') is a complex sentence with a subordinate clause, which is too advanced for the A1 level. The complexity of the sentence distracts from the core task and does not align with the A1 proficiency of understanding 'very simple sentences'.                                             |
|          10 | Llama 4         | Fill Blank      |       3 |      0.85 | This candidate's output is grammatically flawed. It provides two 'correct' answers, but one of them is incorrect in the given context: 'Я живу из Москвы' is wrong; it should be 'Я живу в Москве'. This violates the accuracy requirement. Furthermore, it violates the 'only one correct answer' rule. The English cue '(am)' is also poorly chosen and misleading for a Russian sentence that omits the verb 'to be' in this context.                                                                                              |
|          10 | Mistral Large 3 | Multiple Choice |       7 |      2.15 | The candidate provides an excellent A1-level grammar task (verb conjugation). However, it violates guideline #9 by including the instruction 'Выберите правильное слово:' (Choose the correct word) in the 'question' field. It is better than Candidate 1 as it does not add a translation, but it still fails a key negative constraint.                                                                                                                                                                                            |
|          10 | Mistral Large 3 | Fill Blank      |       3 |      1.44 | This candidate fails a critical guideline. The instruction was to create a task with 'only one correct answer' to be deterministic. Instead, it creates an open-ended prompt where any name would be correct. The `correctAnswer` array lists examples, not the exhaustive or single correct answer. While the sentence 'Меня зовут ____.' is a staple for A1 learners, the task design fundamentally misunderstands the instructions.                                                                                                |
|          10 | Qwen 3 Max      | Multiple Choice |      10 |      3.17 | This is an outstanding response. It perfectly adheres to all instructions. The question is framed as a thought process while writing a letter ('Я пишу письмо... и хочу сказать...'), which cleverly provides context without being a direct instruction, and directly relates to the 'writing a postcard' skill in the level description. The grammar point (adjective-noun agreement) is perfectly suited for A1. The task is natural, clear, and well-designed.                                                                    |

It creates a task directly inspired by the level description ('write a short, simple postcard'). It tests both vocabulary ('открытку' - postcard) and a core A1 grammar concept (the accusative case after the verb 'пишу'). The English cue makes the task completely unambiguous, fulfilling the 'only one correct answer' requirement. The JSON format is perfect.                                                                                     |
|          11 | GPT-5.2         | Multiple Choice |       8 |     12.74 | The task is excellent for A1, testing a core grammatical concept (prepositional case for location) with clear options. It perfectly aligns with the level description. It loses points for a minor formatting error: including an unrequested 'translation' field in the JSON output, which deviates from the specified structure in the instructions.                                                                                                                                                                                |
|          11 | GPT-5.2         | Fill Blank      |       9 |      2.42 | Excellent task that aligns perfectly with the A1 level description of writing a postcard. It tests the set phrase 'с днём рождения' and the instrumental case, making it a good grammar and vocabulary question. The hint '(birthday)' makes the answer highly deterministic. The format is valid.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
|          11 | Gemini 3 Flash  | Multiple Choice |       3 |      1.03 | This candidate has several major flaws. It violates the 'single sentence' rule by providing two. More critically, it tests a complex and ambiguous grammar point (declension of an appositive city name) where multiple answers could be considered correct, violating the 'deterministic' answer requirement. This makes the task unsuitable for an A1 learner.                                                                                                                                                                      |
|          11 | Gemini 3 Flash  | Fill Blank      |      10 |      0.98 | This is a perfect A1 task. It tests the fundamental and fixed expression 'Меня зовут...'. The question is completely deterministic, as only the verb 'зовут' can correctly complete the sentence. It perfectly follows all guidelines regarding level, format, and task design.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
|          11 | Llama 4         | Multiple Choice |       5 |      0.5  | The task tests a valid A1 grammar point (verb + infinitive). However, the sentence structure ('Я живу в городе, где есть...') is too complex for the A1 level, featuring a relative clause that is more typical of A2. This significant level mismatch makes the task less suitable for the target learner, despite the good distractors.                                                                                                                                                                                             |
|          11 | Llama 4         | Fill Blank      |       6 |      0.93 | While the sentence is grammatically correct and level-appropriate, it is not deterministic. The blank for '____ (city)' could be correctly filled with 'городе' (in a city) or the name of a specific city in the prepositional case (e.g., 'Москве'). This ambiguity violates the instruction to have only one correct answer.                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
|          11 | Mistral Large 3 | Multiple Choice |       6 |      1.94 | The task tests relevant A1 vocabulary in a clear context (daily routines). However, it scores lower because it explicitly violates a key guideline by including instructions ('Выберите правильное слово:') within the 'question' field, whereas the prompt strictly forbade including any instructions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
|          11 | Mistral Large 3 | Fill Blank      |       4 |      1.56 | The task is not deterministic as instructed. The blank can be filled with any name, making it an open-ended question rather than a targeted language test. It fails the 'only one correct answer' guideline, as it doesn't test a specific vocabulary word or grammatical structure that has a unique solution.                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
|          11 | Qwen 3 Max      | Multiple Choice |       9 |      3.2  | A very strong candidate. The task correctly tests adjective-noun agreement in the prepositional case, which is appropriate for a high A1 level and aligns well with the 'postcard' writing context. It follows all formatting and content guidelines precisely. The prompt sentence is slightly unnatural but grammatically defensible for a test item.                                                                                                                                                                               |
|          11 | Qwen 3 Max      | Fill Blank      |       2 |      2.23 | The task is fundamentally flawed due to a completely incorrect English hint. The blank requires the noun 'письмо' (letter), but the hint provided is '(to)', which is a preposition represented by the dative case on another word in the sentence. This makes the question nonsensical and unsolvable.                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
|          12 | GPT-5.2         | Multiple Choice |      10 |     14.04 | This is an excellent task that perfectly adheres to all instructions. It correctly interprets the A1 proficiency level, focusing on vocabulary needed for filling in forms ('анкета', 'возраст'). The question is a single, clear sentence without instructions. The options are relevant and create a logical vocabulary puzzle appropriate for the level. The context is natural and the answer is unambiguous.                                                                                                                     |
|          12 | GPT-5.2         | Fill Blank      |       8 |      1.54 | The task is very good and directly relates to the A1 level description of writing a postcard. The phrase 'в отпуске' is appropriate. However, it loses points because another answer, 'отдыхаю' (I am relaxing/vacationing), would also be a natural and correct fit in this context, which slightly violates the guideline for the answer to be deterministic with only one correct option.                                                                                                                                          |
|          12 | Gemini 3 Flash  | Multiple Choice |       5 |      1.39 | The candidate violates the 'single sentence' rule by providing two sentences in the 'question' field. The context ('Меня зовут Иван... Как ___ фамилия?') is slightly unnatural, as one sentence doesn't logically connect to the next without more information. However, the task itself is a good A1-level question testing possessive pronouns and gender agreement, and the distractors are well-chosen.                                                                                                                          |
|          12 | Gemini 3 Flash  | Fill Blank      |       9 |      1.04 | A very strong and well-constructed task. It tests a core A1 introductory phrase ('Меня зовут...'), is grammatically correct, and has only one possible answer, making it perfectly deterministic. It aligns well with the 'personal details' aspect of the A1 level. It is a simple, effective, and flawless execution of the prompt's requirements.                                                                                                                                                                                  |
|          12 | Llama 4         | Multiple Choice |       3 |      0.43 | This candidate completely disregards the 'single sentence' guideline (Guideline 1), providing a three-sentence paragraph as the question. The complexity of the context paragraph, including a relative clause ('где есть...'), is more appropriate for A2 than A1, potentially overwhelming the learner. While the specific grammar point (pronoun in the instrumental case) can be an A1 topic, the overall task complexity is far too high for the target level.                                                                   |
|          12 | Llama 4         | Fill Blank      |       1 |      0.9  | This candidate is fundamentally flawed and demonstrates a critical lack of knowledge of Russian grammar. In modern Russian, the present tense of the verb 'to be' is omitted in such sentences ('Я из Москвы'). The suggested answers, 'есмь' and 'есть', are archaic or used in completely different contexts. This task would teach incorrect Russian and be actively harmful to a learner.                                                                                                                                         |
|          12 | Mistral Large 3 | Multiple Choice |       4 |      1.8  | This candidate fails on several key guidelines. The 'question' field violates the instructions by including an explicit question ('Какой предлог правильно завершает предложение?') instead of just the task sentence. This breaks Guideline 1 ('single sentence') and Guideline 9 ('Do not include any instructions'). While the grammar point (prepositions of motion) is A1, the format is incorrect.                                                                                                                              |
|          12 | Mistral Large 3 | Fill Blank      |       3 |      3.81 | While the sentence 'Меня зовут...' is fundamental for A1 level, this is not a good test item. The blank can be filled with any name, making the answer completely non-deterministic. It fails to test the learner's knowledge of a specific vocabulary word or grammar rule, which is the purpose of a fill-in-the-blank task. It violates guideline #7.                                                                                                                                                                              |
|          12 | Qwen 3 Max      | Multiple Choice |       7 |      3.52 | A good attempt that creates a task highly relevant to the 'writing a postcard/letter' part of the level description. The grammar point (nominative case after 'нравится') is appropriate for A1. However, it violates the 'single sentence' and 'no instructions' guidelines by including a long introductory clause ('Я пишу письмо другу и хочу сказать: ...') which functions as context-setting and instruction, making the question field unnecessarily complex.                                                                 |

It directly references the 'postcard' context from the level description. It tests a key vocabulary word ('открытка') and a crucial A1/A2 grammar point (the accusative case 'открытку'). The answer is deterministic and unambiguous. This is a model example of a well-designed task for the specified level.                                                                                                                                                 |

The Russian sentence 'В анкете я пишу: «Мне ___ лет»' directly uses the context of a form ('анкете'). The grammar point (nominative case for age) is fundamental for A1. The distractors are well-chosen case variations. The output follows all formatting and structural rules.                                                                                                              |

It aligns well with the context of providing personal information. However, it violates guideline #1 ('The task must consist of a single sentence') by presenting the context in two separate sentences.                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

This is one of the first and most important structures a learner encounters. The question is clear, deterministic, and directly relates to providing personal details, aligning perfectly with the level description and all instructions.                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

Additionally, the complexity of the sentence structure and the grammar point is at the higher end of the A1 level, bordering on A2.                                                                                                                                                        |

The standard A1 construction is simply 'Я из Москвы.' The word 'родом' introduces a nuance that is typically taught at the A2 level. The task is therefore slightly too advanced and not focused on the most foundational vocabulary for A1.                                                                                                                     |

The question includes the instruction 'Выберите правильное слово:' which was explicitly forbidden by guideline #9 ('Do not include any instructions for the task').

The proposed sentence 'Меня зовут Анна Иванов' is grammatically incorrect, as it pairs a feminine first name with a masculine surname. Furthermore, the task is not deterministic as instructed; any masculine name could fit the blank, making it a prompt for information rather than a test of a specific word or grammatical form. It fundamentally misunderstands the nature of a fill-in-the-blank language test.                                                              |

Furthermore, 'родом' is arguably an A2-level word, making the task's difficulty questionable for A1.                                                                                                 |

The sentence 'Я живу в ____ (city)' is grammatically correct with the answer 'городе'. However, the phrasing 'I live in a city' is slightly unnatural for an introduction. A better task design would provide the nominative case to be conjugated (e.g., '...в ____ (город)') to make the grammar objective clearer and less ambiguous.                                                                                                                     |

The task directly uses the 'postcard' theme from the proficiency description, testing relevant vocabulary ('открытка') and a core grammatical concept (accusative case). The sentence is natural and perfectly suited for the A1 level. The only minor weakness is that another word, 'письмо' (letter), could also fit the blank, slightly violating the 'only one correct answer' rule, though the hint strongly guides the user.                                                                              |

However, it violates a guideline by translating the options into English within the options list. The original instruction was 'translate the necessary parts to English', which is ambiguous, but this implementation is clunky. The JSON format for `correctAnswer` is a string, not an array as specified in the instructions' example.                                                                                                                            |

However, it fails on the 'only one correct answer' rule. The conjunction 'по которым' is an equally valid and common alternative to 'почему' in this context, but it was not included in the 'correctAnswer' array.                                                                                                                                                                                           |

The distractors are cleverly designed by mixing parts of correct collocations. It perfectly aligns with the 'writing a report' skill. A point is deducted for not following the specified format for `correctAnswer` (it's a string instead of an array).                                                                                                                                                                          |

The context is also excellent. However, it violates the determinism rule by providing only 'невзирая' as the correct answer, when 'несмотря' is an equally correct and even more common synonym that should have been included.                                                                                                                                                                  |

It correctly tests a specific and challenging grammatical construction ('находить что-то + instrumental case') that distinguishes intermediate from upper-intermediate learners. The sentence is natural, the answer is unique and unambiguous, and the context of expressing an opinion aligns well with B2 skills. It perfectly follows all instructions.                                                                                                                                                                              |

Furthermore, the task itself, while testing verbs of motion, is more suited for a B1 level rather than B2. A B2 learner should find this task relatively simple.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

The use of 'Несмотря на...' and testing verb aspect ('пойти') is appropriate. However, the core grammatical point (choosing a perfective infinitive after 'решили') is typically mastered at the B1 level. The task lacks the complexity expected for a solid B2 assessment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

However, the execution is flawed because one of the distractors, 'поселоваться', is a non-existent word. A well-designed task should use plausible but incorrect distractors, not invented words, which makes the choice artificially easy for the learner.                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

The verb 'объяснить' does not collocate with the preposition 'о' ('about'). The correct structure would be 'объяснить важность' (accusative). This fundamental error makes the task unsuitable for language learning.                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

It tests a B2-level grammar point (dative case governed by the preposition 'благодаря' and adjective agreement) within a relevant context (work/conference). The distractors are well-chosen, especially 'искренной', which tests a finer orthographic point.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

The JSON is valid. It's scored slightly below perfect because another answer, 'по которым', is also grammatically correct and natural in this context, which slightly undermines the 'only one correct answer' guideline. However, 'почему' is the most direct translation of the English cue '(why)'.                                                                                                                   |

The sentence structure is complex and the context (writing a formal report) directly relates to the CEFR description for B2 writing. It tests knowledge of formal vocabulary and collocations ('излагать аргументы') by providing semantically related but contextually incorrect distractors. It fully adheres to all instructions.                                                                                                                                                                  |

It correctly tests the use of the imperfective infinitive after the verb 'начать'. However, the level feels closer to B1 than a solid B2. While it involves a complex sentence, the context and vocabulary are quite general and don't fully capture the B2 proficiency of writing essays or reports on a wide range of subjects.                                                                                                                                                              |

The use of 'Несмотря на...' and testing verb aspect after 'решить' is appropriate for an intermediate level. However, the overall complexity and vocabulary feel more aligned with a B1 level rather than the specified B2 level, which emphasizes writing reports and complex arguments.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
|           2 | Qwen 3 Max      | Multiple Choice |      10 |      4.77 | An excellent task that perfectly meets all requirements. It tests a crucial B2 skill: the use of verb aspect and tense in complex sentences with subordinate clauses. The context is natural and aligns with the level description. The distinction between 'решил' (perfective) and 'решал' (imperfective) is a key challenge at this level.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
|           2 | Qwen 3 Max      | Fill Blank      |       5 |      3.09 | The task fails on two key points. Firstly, the grammatical point tested (simple past tense with aspect) is more suitable for an A2/B1 level, not B2. Secondly, the correct answer is ambiguous regarding gender ('прочитал' for masculine, 'прочитала' for feminine), but only one form is provided, violating the guideline for a deterministic answer.                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

It correctly tests the agreement of a past passive participle with the noun it modifies in the accusative case, a key grammatical skill at this level. The sentence context (grant application) is appropriate. The options are well-constructed, representing different case endings of the same word. It follows all instructions, including the JSON format and the no-instructions rule.                                                                                                                                              |

The vocabulary ('отчёт', 'прийти к выводу', 'уложиться в сроки') and the complex sentence structure are fitting. The context of a report aligns with the B2 writing description. The only minor drawback is that while 'пересмотреть' is the best fit, another verb like 'доработать' (to refine) could also be considered a possible answer, slightly violating the 'only one correct answer' rule.                                                                                                    |
|           3 | Gemini 3 Flash  | Multiple Choice |       5 |    332.3  | The task targets an advanced distinction between near-synonyms ('невзирая' vs. 'несмотря'), which is appropriate for B2/C1. However, the task is critically flawed because both 'невзирая' and 'несмотря' are grammatically correct and widely accepted in this context. This violates the core requirement for a single, deterministic correct answer, making it a poor multiple-choice question.                                                                                                                                                                           |

The vocabulary ('приведённые аргументы', 'точка зрения', 'обосновать') is advanced and appropriate. The context of justifying a point of view directly aligns with the B2 writing skill description. The chosen word 'обосновать' is the most precise and direct translation for '(to justify)' in this context, making it a strong, single-best answer, even if other synonyms could technically fit.                                                                                             |
|           3 | Llama 4         | Multiple Choice |       7 |      0.6  | The task addresses a relevant B2 grammar point (tense and voice of verbs in a subordinate clause). However, the sentence is excessively long and complex, which can obscure the core objective. More importantly, the choice between the correct answer ('используются' - are used) and the distractor ('использовались' - were used) is slightly ambiguous, potentially violating the guideline that the answer must be deterministic.                                                                                                                                      |

However, it tests the use of multidirectional verbs of motion ('хожу') with an adverb of frequency ('часто'). This is a standard topic for A2/B1 levels and is not sufficiently challenging for a B2 learner. The context is simple and does not align with the advanced writing skills described for the level.                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
|           3 | Mistral Large 3 | Multiple Choice |       6 |      2.77 | The task itself, testing the conditional mood ('если бы...'), is excellent and perfectly suited for the B2 level. However, the candidate failed to follow a strict guideline by including instructions ('Выберите правильный вариант, чтобы завершить предложение:') within the 'question' field. The prompt explicitly forbids including any instructions for the task.                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

However, it tests the choice of a perfective verb of motion ('пойти'), which is a core concept typically mastered at the B1 level. The task does not adequately challenge a B2 learner or reflect the complexity described in the proficiency level (e.g., writing reports, essays).                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

It tests vocabulary nuance and collocation ('преодолеть трудности' - to overcome difficulties), which is a key skill for advanced learners. The sentence structure is complex enough for B2, the context is natural, and the distractors are plausible but incorrect synonyms. It's a well-designed, deterministic question.                                                                                                                                                                     |
|           3 | Qwen 3 Max      | Fill Blank      |       3 |      3.67 | The task is fundamentally flawed as the blank is placed incorrectly and the word intended for the blank ('готовился') is already present in the question sentence. Even if this were corrected, the grammatical point being tested (imperfective aspect for duration with 'весь день') is a B1-level concept, not B2.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

However, it critically fails by including an English translation of the correct answer within the question ('(EN: nevertheless)'), which trivializes the task and violates guideline #7. The JSON format for 'correctAnswer' also deviates slightly from the example (string instead of array).                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

The format is correct. However, it violates the 'only one correct answer' guideline, as 'за' would also be a grammatically correct and natural answer. The task is good but not perfectly deterministic.                                                                                                                                                                           |

However, it violates guideline #9 by including instructions in the 'question' field. The distinction between 'тем не менее' and 'впрочем', while testing a good nuance, could be considered slightly ambiguous in some contexts.                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

The task is unambiguously at the B2 level, testing the crucial conjunction 'несмотря на' within a formal, argumentative context ('эксперты высказываются', 'финансовые риски'). The answer is unique and deterministic, making it a high-quality assessment item.                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

It perfectly adheres to all instructions, including the JSON structure and the array format for 'correctAnswer'. The task itself is an excellent B2-level vocabulary question testing collocation ('посвятить карьеру') in a natural and relevant context, with clear, unambiguous options.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

The JSON format is incorrect, nesting the response within an unnecessary structure. The task level is A1, which is far below the requested B2. Most importantly, it fundamentally violates the instruction to create a task with a single, deterministic answer by providing a question with dozens of possible correct answers.                                                                                                                                                                                           |
|           4 | Mistral Large 3 | Multiple Choice |       6 |      2.53 | This is a solid B2 grammar task testing the conditional mood, with well-chosen distractors. Its main weakness is the direct violation of guideline #9, as it includes explicit instructions ('Выберите правильный вариант...') within the 'question' field, which was strictly forbidden.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

However, the task itself is more suitable for a B1 level. Choosing the correct infinitive of a verb of motion after 'решили' is a skill typically mastered before B2. The task does not adequately challenge a B2 learner's ability to handle complex syntax or vocabulary as described in the prompt.                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

The question is clean, natural, and unambiguous. It adheres to almost all instructions, with the only minor flaw being the format of 'correctAnswer' as a string instead of a single-element array.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

The context of a project report aligns with the proficiency description. However, the grammatical point is somewhat basic for B2, and the JSON format for 'correctAnswer' should have been an array, not a string, as per the instructions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

The context of writing a formal report directly reflects the B2 proficiency description. The task tests a sophisticated and context-dependent vocabulary item ('остановиться на' meaning 'to dwell on'), which is an excellent indicator of B2/C1 proficiency. The sentence structure is complex and natural. Despite a minor format deviation ('correctAnswer' as a string), the overall high quality and relevance of the linguistic challenge make this the best candidate.                     |
|           5 | Gemini 3 Flash  | Fill Blank      |      10 |      1.27 | This is an outstanding task for the B2 level. It tests the use of a complex preposition ('несмотря на') to express concession, which is a key skill for constructing nuanced arguments. The vocabulary is formal and appropriate for the level. The answer is correct, deterministic, and the sentence structure is suitably complex.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
|           5 | Llama 4         | Multiple Choice |       8 |      0.6  | The candidate created a strong B2-level task testing the subtle difference between perfective and imperfective aspects ('жила' vs. 'прожила'). It also correctly followed the JSON formatting instruction for 'correctAnswer' by using an array. However, the question contains a grammatical error ('о истории' instead of 'об истории'), which is a significant flaw in a language task.                                                                                                                                                                                   |

Second, it fails on the 'deterministic' instruction. The correct answer could be 'начал' (masculine) or 'начала' (feminine), but the candidate only provided the feminine form, making the answer incomplete and assuming the speaker's gender.                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
|           5 | Mistral Large 3 | Multiple Choice |       7 |      2.6  | The linguistic task itself is excellent, testing the subjunctive mood ('если бы... я бы...') which is a perfect B2-level challenge. However, the candidate failed to follow a strict negative constraint by including instructions ('Выберите правильный вариант...') in the 'question' field, which was explicitly forbidden.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
|           5 | Mistral Large 3 | Fill Blank      |       5 |      1.65 | The task is grammatically correct and the format is valid. However, the difficulty level is too low for B2. Testing a verb of motion after 'решить' (to decide) is a concept typically mastered at the A2 or B1 level. It does not challenge a B2 learner sufficiently.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
|           5 | Qwen 3 Max      | Multiple Choice |       9 |      4.01 | This is an excellent task. The complex sentence structure and the specific grammatical point (requiring a perfective infinitive after 'удалось') are perfectly suited for the B2 level. The context aligns well with the prompt's guidelines. The only minor flaw is that the 'correctAnswer' was provided as a string instead of an array.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

The context of writing an essay and presenting arguments ('эссе', 'аргументы') directly reflects the B2 writing skills described in the original instruction. The vocabulary is appropriate, and the answer is the most fitting word for the sentence, making the task both relevant and deterministic.                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
|           6 | GPT-5.2         | Multiple Choice |       8 |     13.3  | The linguistic task is excellent and appropriate for the B2 level, testing verb aspect in a clause of purpose with advanced vocabulary. However, the output violates the specified JSON format by adding an unrequested 'english' field. The 'correctAnswer' is a string, which is a possible but less safe interpretation of the ambiguous instruction.                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

The grammar is correct. However, the instruction to have only one correct answer is not strictly met. While 'подробно объяснил' is a good fit, a simpler 'объяснил' or other verbs like 'изложил' or 'описал' would also be grammatically correct and contextually appropriate, making the answer not entirely deterministic.                                                                |

It tests knowledge of formal register and collocations ('аргументы в пользу') directly relevant to writing reports and essays. The vocabulary, context, and distractors are all highly appropriate. It follows all instructions, with the only minor issue being the ambiguous 'correctAnswer' format.                                                                                                                                                                                    |
|           6 | Gemini 3 Flash  | Fill Blank      |       7 |      1.45 | The linguistic quality of this task is very high. It uses a complex sentence structure and advanced vocabulary ('законопроект', 'выступали против') suitable for a B2 or even C1 level. However, it fails significantly on the 'only one correct answer' constraint. Both 'принять' and 'утвердить' are very strong and common alternatives to 'одобрить' in the context of passing a bill, making the provided answer one of several possibilities.                                                                                                                         |

However, the linguistic point being tested (imperfective infinitive after 'любить') is more characteristic of a B1 level, making the task slightly too easy for a B2 assessment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

The primary issue is the non-uniqueness of the answer. 'Работаю над' is a direct synonym and equally correct alternative to 'занимаюсь', which is a clear violation of a key guideline.                                                                                                                                                                                 |

It also violates a strict guideline by including instructions ('Выберите правильный вариант...') directly in the 'question' field.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
|           6 | Mistral Large 3 | Fill Blank      |       6 |      1.54 | This task tests the choice of verb aspect after 'решить', which is a core grammar point, but it's more characteristic of the B1 level. The context is a simple daily routine, which doesn't fully reflect the complexity expected at B2 (writing reports, essays). Most importantly, the answer is not unique; 'отправиться' is a very common and perfectly valid alternative to 'пойти', which violates a strict guideline.                                                                                                                                                 |

It tests knowledge of sophisticated vocabulary and collocation ('преодолеть трудности') within a grammatically complex sentence. The context is appropriate, the options are well-chosen, and it adheres to all guidelines, with the minor exception of using a string for 'correctAnswer' based on an ambiguous instruction.                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

The context ('написал письмо другу, чтобы ... важность') directly reflects the B2 skill description ('write letters highlighting the personal significance'). The vocabulary ('подчеркнуть важность') is appropriate for the level, and the phrase is a strong collocation, making 'подчеркнуть' the most natural and expected answer, thus closely adhering to the 'only one correct answer' rule. The format and accuracy are flawless.                                                               |

The vocabulary and context (business trip, report deadline) are well-suited for B2. The options are distinct and test a clear grammatical point. The only minor issue is the 'correctAnswer' format, which the prompt ambiguously suggested should be an array.                                                                                                                                                                             |

However, the answer is not strictly deterministic as 'описал' (described) could also fit, and the verb form 'изложил' is gender-specific, whereas 'изложила' is also correct for a female speaker, violating the 'only one correct answer' rule.                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

It uses a complex sentence structure with advanced vocabulary and tests a nuanced point of verb government (collocation with a specific preposition and case). This requires a sophisticated understanding of Russian syntax and lexis, directly contributing to the ability to write clear, detailed, and accurate text, as described for the B2 level.                                                                                                                               |

The prompt explicitly stated 'Do not include any instructions for the task' and 'The task must consist of a single sentence'.                                                                                                                                                                                      |
|           7 | Mistral Large 3 | Fill Blank      |       5 |      1.41 | The task is grammatically correct and deterministic. However, the difficulty level is too low for B2. Testing 'решили пойти' (decided to go) is more appropriate for A2 or B1 levels and does not reflect the complexity of writing essays or reports as described in the prompt.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
|           7 | Qwen 3 Max      | Multiple Choice |       6 |      5.82 | The task is grammatically sound, but its difficulty is more aligned with the B1 level than B2. Choosing between perfective and imperfective aspect for a single, completed past action is a foundational skill consolidated at B1. A B2 task should test a more complex or nuanced application of aspect or grammar.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
|           7 | Qwen 3 Max      | Fill Blank      |      10 |      3.9  | Excellent task. It perfectly matches the B2 level by using a professional context (report for management) and testing a key collocation ('обратить внимание'). The question is unambiguous and has a single correct answer. The inclusion of '(а)' to account for gender is a thoughtful detail.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
|           8 | GPT-5.2         | Multiple Choice |       7 |     16.58 | The candidate created a linguistically sound task appropriate for the B2 level, testing future tense and aspect in a complex sentence. However, it violates several strict guidelines: 1) Guideline 7 is violated by including an English translation '(will accept)' in the question. 2) The JSON format for the 'correctAnswer' field is a string, not an array as specified in the example schema. 3) The inclusion of non-sentence text violates Guideline 1.                                                                                                            |
|           8 | GPT-5.2         | Fill Blank      |       8 |      1.87 | This is a strong candidate. The vocabulary ('изложил') and the context (writing a report to persuade management) are perfectly aligned with the B2 level description. The sentence is natural and grammatically correct. The main weakness is that it doesn't fully adhere to the 'only one correct answer' rule. Verbs like 'представил' (presented) or 'описал' (described) would also fit the sentence, creating ambiguity.                                                                                                                                               |
|           8 | Gemini 3 Flash  | Multiple Choice |      10 |      1.72 | This is an outstanding task that perfectly aligns with the B2 level. The sentence structure is complex, the vocabulary is advanced and formal ('отчёт', 'проделанная работа'), and the question requires a nuanced understanding of verb government and aspect. It directly tests skills needed for writing reports as described in the proficiency description. The only minor issue is the 'correctAnswer' being a string and not an array, but the overall quality of the linguistic task is superior to all other candidates and best fulfills the spirit of the prompt. |
|           8 | Gemini 3 Flash  | Fill Blank      |       9 |      1.96 | An excellent task that aligns perfectly with the B2 level. The vocabulary ('обосновать') and the collocation ('обосновать свою точку зрения') are highly relevant. The context, concerning an author justifying a viewpoint in an article, directly matches the prompt's description. Although a close synonym ('аргументировать') exists, the chosen answer 'обосновать' is the most precise fit for the English hint '(justify)' and the adverb 'убедительно' (convincingly), making it the most well-constrained and high-quality task among the candidates.              |
|           8 | Llama 4         | Multiple Choice |       6 |      0.53 | The candidate followed the JSON format instructions perfectly. However, the task itself is weak. The concept being tested (imperfective aspect for repeated past actions marked by 'часто') is more characteristic of the B1 level, not B2. Additionally, one of the distractors, 'встречался с утра', is poorly constructed as it's not parallel to the other options and creates an awkward sentence, testing parsing rather than a specific grammar point.                                                                                                                |
|           8 | Llama 4         | Fill Blank      |       5 |      0.52 | This task is too simple for the B2 level, feeling more like a B1 grammar exercise on verb aspects. The context is generic and doesn't align with the prompt's focus on writing reports or essays. The most significant issue is the violation of the single-answer rule; 'учить' (imperfective aspect) and 'знать' (to know) are also perfectly correct and logical answers in this context.                                                                                                                                                                                 |
|           8 | Mistral Large 3 | Multiple Choice |       9 |      2.6  | This is an excellent B2-level task testing the unreal conditional mood, a key competency for this level. The JSON format is perfect, including the 'correctAnswer' as an array. The only flaw is a clear violation of Guideline 9 ('Do not include any instructions for the task'), as the question string begins with 'Выберите правильный вариант, чтобы завершить предложение:'.                                                                                                                                                                                          |
|           8 | Mistral Large 3 | Fill Blank      |       6 |      1.88 | The task is grammatically correct, but its complexity is more suited for a B1 level rather than B2. The vocabulary (verbs of motion) is typically mastered at a lower level. The context of 'going for a walk' does not reflect the specified B2 writing skills. Furthermore, it violates the single-answer constraint, as 'отправиться' (to set off) is an equally valid answer.                                                                                                                                                                                            |
|           8 | Qwen 3 Max      | Multiple Choice |       9 |      4.79 | The candidate produced a high-quality B2-level task that effectively tests verb government ('удалось' + infinitive) and aspectual choice (perfective for a completed action). The context is appropriate and the distractors are well-chosen. It follows all guidelines except for a minor formatting error: 'correctAnswer' is a string instead of an array as shown in the instruction's example.                                                                                                                                                                          |
|           8 | Qwen 3 Max      | Fill Blank      |       5 |      2.67 | While the context of writing a report to express a point of view is appropriate for B2, the task fails significantly on the 'only one correct answer' rule. There are numerous valid, and arguably better, answers like 'обосновать' (to justify), 'изложить' (to state), or 'отстоять' (to defend). The chosen answer, 'поддержать' (to support), is not the most idiomatic choice in this specific collocation.                                                                                                                                                            |
|           9 | GPT-5.2         | Multiple Choice |       8 |     18.21 | A well-constructed task that is grammatically accurate and suitable for the B2 level, testing verb forms in a relevant context. It adheres to most guidelines. Points are deducted for minor JSON format deviations: `correctAnswer` is a string instead of an array, and an extra `translation` field was included, which was not part of the final requested schema.                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
|           9 | GPT-5.2         | Fill Blank      |      10 |      1.84 | This is an excellent task for the B2 level. The sentence structure ('Хотя..., ...') is appropriately complex. The vocabulary ('доклад', 'выводы') aligns with the B2 skill of writing reports. Most importantly, it tests a key grammatical point for this level: the use of the instrumental case after the verb 'оказаться'. The answer is unambiguous and the task is natural.                                                                                                                                                                                            |
|           9 | Gemini 3 Flash  | Multiple Choice |       9 |      2    | An outstanding task that aligns perfectly with the B2 level description, testing knowledge of collocations ('аргументы в пользу') within a formal context. The vocabulary and scenario are highly appropriate for the level. It follows all major guidelines, with a minor point off for incorrect JSON formatting of the `correctAnswer` field (string instead of array).                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
|           9 | Gemini 3 Flash  | Fill Blank      |      10 |      1.12 | An outstanding task that perfectly aligns with the B2 level description. It uses a complex sentence structure ('...несмотря на то что...'), advanced academic vocabulary ('аргументирует', 'позиция', 'оспаривают'), and a context directly related to argumentation and expressing points of view. The verb 'оспаривают' is a precise, high-level vocabulary choice.                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
|           9 | Llama 4         | Multiple Choice |       1 |      1.1  | This candidate fundamentally misunderstood the prompt. Instead of creating a language learning task to test proficiency, it generated a meta-linguistic question about grammatical theory. This does not assess a user's ability to use Russian as required. It also violated the 'no instructions' rule.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
|           9 | Llama 4         | Fill Blank      |       9 |      0.4  | This is a very good task that tests the common and important collocation 'уделять внимание' (to pay attention). Mastery of such set phrases is a key indicator of B2 proficiency. The context of business is relevant, and the use of 'В последнее время' correctly signals the imperfective aspect, making the answer unambiguous.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
|           9 | Mistral Large 3 | Multiple Choice |       7 |      2.56 | The linguistic task itself is excellent, perfectly targeting a key B2 grammar point (subjunctive mood with verb aspect). The JSON format is also correct. However, it scores lower because it directly violates a strict negative constraint by including instructions ('Выберите правильный вариант...') within the 'question' field.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
|           9 | Mistral Large 3 | Fill Blank      |       7 |      1.88 | The task is grammatically correct and natural. The structure 'Несмотря на...' is suitable for B2. However, the core challenge — choosing the perfective infinitive 'пойти' after 'решили' — is a concept often mastered at the B1 level. While verbs of motion are complex, this particular task doesn't fully challenge a B2 learner's writing skills as described in the prompt.                                                                                                                                                                                           |
|           9 | Qwen 3 Max      | Multiple Choice |       9 |      4.15 | An excellent task that tests a nuanced understanding of verb aspect in a subordinate clause, which is a hallmark of the B2 level. The context is natural and the options are well-chosen. It follows nearly all instructions perfectly, with only a minor deduction for the `correctAnswer` field being a string instead of the requested array format.                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
|           9 | Qwen 3 Max      | Fill Blank      |       9 |      3.89 | A very strong candidate. The topic (climate change, renewable energy) is highly relevant for B2-level discussions. The task effectively tests the important collocation 'играть роль' (to play a role), which is crucial for producing more natural and advanced text. The vocabulary is appropriate and the answer is deterministic.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
|          10 | GPT-5.2         | Multiple Choice |       8 |     26.51 | The task correctly tests the use of conjunctions to show contrast, which is a B2 skill. The sentence is natural and the context is clear. It loses points for two reasons: the difficulty is on the lower end of B2, and the `correctAnswer` field is a string instead of an array, which does not match the format specified in the prompt's example.                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

However, it violates the strict non-ambiguity rule, as several other verbs like 'объяснил' (explained) or 'описал' (described) are also perfectly valid. Furthermore, the answer only includes the masculine form ('изложил'), omitting the necessary feminine counterpart ('изложила').                                                                                                                                                                                  |
|          10 | Gemini 3 Flash  | Multiple Choice |       9 |      1.89 | This is a high-quality, challenging task that perfectly aligns with B2+ proficiency. It tests the agreement and case of participles within a complex sentence, a skill essential for writing the 'clear, detailed text' mentioned in the level description. The vocabulary and context are sophisticated. It loses one point only for the minor formatting error of providing `correctAnswer` as a string instead of an array.                                                                                                                                               |
|          10 | Gemini 3 Flash  | Fill Blank      |       3 |      1.14 | While the task aims for an appropriate B2/C1 level of complexity, it contains a major grammatical error. The proposed answer 'противоречит' (contradicts) is incompatible with the preposition 'с' used in the sentence. The verb 'противоречить' governs the dative case without a preposition. This fundamental flaw makes the task incorrect as presented.                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

The JSON is valid and strictly follows the specified format, including the `correctAnswer` field as an array. The task itself is a solid B2-level question that tests verb aspect after a modal verb ('нужно') within a clause of purpose, a key skill for this level. The context is clear and the distractors are appropriate.                                                                                                                                                                                       |
|          10 | Llama 4         | Fill Blank      |       8 |      1.5  | This is the best candidate. It effectively tests a B2-level grammatical structure (passive voice with a modal verb) on a relevant topic. While 'могут' (can) is a possible alternative, the context and the English hint '(must)' strongly point to 'должны' as the single intended answer, making it the least ambiguous of the options. The task is well-constructed and level-appropriate.                                                                                                                                                                                |
|          10 | Mistral Large 3 | Multiple Choice |       5 |      2.34 | While the linguistic task itself is excellent, testing a common but difficult point of Russian grammar (verbs of motion and aspect), the candidate failed to follow a strict guideline. It explicitly violates guideline #9 ('Do not include any instructions for the task') by including 'Выберите правильный вариант, чтобы завершить предложение:' in the question field. This is a significant deviation from the instructions.                                                                                                                                          |
|          10 | Mistral Large 3 | Fill Blank      |       4 |      1.67 | The task is grammatically correct but is too simple for the B2 level; choosing a verb of motion in this context is typically an A2/B1 skill. Most importantly, it fails the non-ambiguity requirement, as 'пойти' (to go) and 'отправиться' (to set off) are equally correct and common alternatives to 'выйти'.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

It tests verb aspect following a specific construction ('удалось' + infinitive) within a complex sentence, which is highly appropriate for the level. The vocabulary and grammar are well-chosen. The only flaw is a minor formatting error where `correctAnswer` is provided as a string instead of an array.                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

However, it fails the strict non-ambiguity rule, as 'рассказал(а)' (told/narrated) is a very common and perfectly suitable alternative to 'объяснил(а)' (explained).                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

However, it violates a guideline by including an English translation in the question, likely due to a contradictory instruction in the original prompt. Additionally, the `correctAnswer` format is a string instead of an array as specified in the prompt's description.                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

It tests the specific construction 'в пользу' (in favor of). However, it loses points because there are other equally valid answers, such as 'за' or 'в поддержку', which were not included in the 'correctAnswer' array, thus violating the instruction about deterministic answers.                                                                                                                  |

It follows all non-contradictory instructions perfectly, uses appropriate formal vocabulary, and has clear, well-differentiated options. The only minor deviation is the `correctAnswer` format (string vs. array).                                                                                                                                                                                            |

It tests a specific and useful verb-preposition combination ('настаивать на' - to insist on) that is key for expressing opinions and arguments. The answer is unambiguous, and the sentence is natural and well-formed.                                                                                                                                                                                  |

Testing the difference between 'хожу' and 'идти' (verbs of motion) is a classic A2 or B1 level grammar point. The context and vocabulary are too simple for a B2 learner, failing to meet the requirements of the prompt.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

It correctly tests Russian verb aspect after the verb 'решить'. However, the topic and vocabulary are more suited for a B1 level rather than B2. It does not reflect the complexity described in the B2 writing skills (essays, reports, argumentation). Additionally, 'отправиться' is another possible correct answer that was not listed.                                                                                                                                                                 |

The context of 'getting a job' described in a letter aligns well with the CEFR level description. The `correctAnswer` format is a string instead of an array, which is a minor format deviation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

A more natural verb choice would be 'подкрепить' (to reinforce). This unnatural phrasing makes the task confusing and less effective for assessment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

However, the task violates the 'only one correct answer' guideline. The verb `представить` is an equally valid and common synonym for `привести` in this context but was not included in the `correctAnswer` array.

More importantly, it creates a subjective, open-ended question ('choose the best continuation') with no single deterministic correct answer; all options are logically plausible reasons. This violates the core principle of a deterministic language task.                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

The task is clear, accurate, and unambiguous.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
|          12 | Mistral Large 3 | Multiple Choice |       4 |      2.43 | Fails to follow key instructions. It includes explicit instructions in the 'question' field ('Выберите правильный вариант...'), violating a negative constraint. Furthermore, the vocabulary tested ('слишком') is more appropriate for an A2/B1 level, not the requested B2.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
|          12 | Mistral Large 3 | Fill Blank      |       8 |      1.8  | The task is valid and tests relevant vocabulary (`управлять`) for the B2 level. However, the overall sentence structure is somewhat simpler compared to other candidates. While a good task, it borders on the B1 level and is less challenging than what a B2 learner should be able to handle.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
|          12 | Qwen 3 Max      | Multiple Choice |       8 |      6.43 | A good and compliant task. It correctly tests vocabulary (verb collocation) in a complex sentence relevant to the level description ('received a letter... described in detail'). The level is appropriate for B2, though the core collocation 'преодолеть трудности' might be familiar to some B1 learners, making it slightly less challenging than other top candidates.                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
|          12 | Qwen 3 Max      | Fill Blank      |      10 |      3.12 | This is an exemplary task. It perfectly tests a core grammatical concept for the B2 level: the use of the imperfective present tense to describe an action that has been ongoing for a period of time. The sentence is natural, the answer is unambiguous, and the context is relatable.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
|          13 | GPT-5.2         | Multiple Choice |       8 |     20.77 | The task is well-designed, level-appropriate (B2), and deterministic. It correctly tests the use of discourse markers ('однако') in a relevant business context, which aligns with the B2 skill of writing reports. The JSON format is correct. A minor deduction is made because including the question and its translation within the 'question' field is slightly awkward, though it is a reasonable interpretation of the instructions.                                                                                                                                  |
|          13 | GPT-5.2         | Fill Blank      |       9 |      1.93 | The task is very well-constructed and appropriate for the B2 level. It uses a complex sentence structure within a formal context (a report), which aligns perfectly with the CEFR description provided. The required phrase 'решили отказаться' tests both vocabulary and grammar (aspect and modality). The task is accurate, natural-sounding, and has a deterministic answer. It's an excellent example of a B2-level task.                                                                                                                                               |
|          13 | Gemini 3 Flash  | Multiple Choice |       9 |      1.25 | This is an excellent task that perfectly aligns with the B2 level and the prompt's description of writing skills ('излагать свою позицию в эссе'). It tests a clear and important grammatical point (use of the infinitive after 'необходимо') with well-chosen distractors. The answer is deterministic and the context is highly relevant. The only minor flaw is the failure to include a small English translation as requested by the original instructions.                                                                                                            |
|          13 | Gemini 3 Flash  | Fill Blank      |      10 |      1.26 | This is a perfect B2-level task. It tests the knowledge of a fixed prepositional phrase, 'в поддержку', which is crucial for formal and argumentative writing. This aligns directly with the B2 skill description 'giving reasons in support of or against a particular point of view'. The task is concise, unambiguous, and tests a key piece of vocabulary for academic and formal contexts.                                                                                                                                                                              |
|          13 | Llama 4         | Multiple Choice |       2 |      0.74 | This candidate completely fails to create a valid language task. The question is not deterministic; all options are grammatically correct and plausible continuations of the long, convoluted sentence. It does not test a specific language skill but rather asks the user to guess an arbitrary detail. This violates the core requirement for a clear objective and a single correct answer.                                                                                                                                                                              |
|          13 | Llama 4         | Fill Blank      |       6 |      0.66 | The candidate provides a valid JSON and a grammatically correct sentence. However, the grammatical point being tested—the use of the present imperfective tense with 'в последнее время'—is more appropriate for the B1 level. A B2 learner is expected to have already mastered this. The task does not challenge the complex writing skills specified for the B2 level.                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
|          13 | Mistral Large 3 | Multiple Choice |       5 |      2.54 | The candidate fails on several instructions. It includes explicit instructions ('Выберите правильный вариант...'), which was forbidden. It also fails to provide any English translation. While the grammar point (subjunctive mood) is relevant, the task's difficulty is borderline B1/B2, and the context is very simple. The format is correct, but the instruction-following is poor.                                                                                                                                                                                   |
|          13 | Mistral Large 3 | Fill Blank      |       6 |      1.63 | While the format is correct and the sentence is grammatically sound, the task itself is too simple for the B2 level. The structure 'решили + perfective infinitive' (решили пойти) is typically mastered at the A2 or B1 level. It does not test the specific B2 writing skills mentioned in the prompt, such as constructing complex arguments or writing detailed reports.                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
|          13 | Qwen 3 Max      | Multiple Choice |       3 |      3.34 | This task is fundamentally flawed because it is not deterministic. The choice between 'пошёл' and 'ходил' (verbs of motion) is highly context-dependent, and in this sentence, 'ходил' could also be argued as the correct answer, representing a completed round trip. A multiple-choice question must have a single, unambiguously correct answer. This ambiguity makes it a poor assessment item.                                                                                                                                                                         |
|          13 | Qwen 3 Max      | Fill Blank      |      10 |      3    | This is an outstanding candidate. The task tests the use of a past adverbial participle ('обобщив'), which is an advanced grammatical structure characteristic of sophisticated B2/C1 writing. The context of summarizing findings in a report directly corresponds to the writing skills described in the original instruction. The task is unambiguous, accurate, and highly relevant.                                                                                                                                                                                     |
|          14 | GPT-5.2         | Multiple Choice |       8 |     20.46 | The task is well-designed and appropriate for the B2 level, testing the use of complex linking words ('при этом') in a formal context, which aligns with the writing skills described. The grammar is accurate, and the distractors are plausible. However, it slightly violates the instruction to avoid including instructions by adding 'Какая фраза должна стоять на месте пропуска в предложении' to the 'question' field.                                                                                                                                              |
|          14 | GPT-5.2         | Fill Blank      |       8 |      1.36 | The task is excellent in terms of level-appropriateness. The vocabulary ('отчёт', 'исследование', 'руководство') and the context (writing a report) directly align with the B2 proficiency description. The main flaw is that it violates guideline #9. For the subject 'я' (I), the past tense verb could be masculine ('обобщил') or feminine ('обобщила'). The 'correctAnswer' array should have included both forms.                                                                                                                                                     |
|          14 | Gemini 3 Flash  | Multiple Choice |      10 |      1.34 | This is an excellent B2-level task. It tests a nuanced grammatical point: the difference between a participial adjective modifying a noun ('аргументы, обосновывающие...') and an adverbial participle. This is a key skill for constructing complex, precise sentences in formal writing, directly aligning with the level description. The context ('аналитический отчёт') is perfect, the options are well-chosen, and all instructions have been followed meticulously.                                                                                                  |
|          14 | Gemini 3 Flash  | Fill Blank      |      10 |      1.49 | This is an outstanding submission that perfectly adheres to all guidelines. The task is deterministic with only one correct answer. The vocabulary ('глобальное потепление', 'последствия', 'необратимыми', 'предпринять решительных действий') is advanced and perfectly suited for the B2 level. The grammatical point being tested (the use of 'если... не' for 'unless') is subtle and appropriate for B2. The context is complex and relevant.                                                                                                                          |
|          14 | Llama 4         | Multiple Choice |       2 |      1.65 | This candidate has two major flaws. First, the task level is A2/B1, testing basic adjectival agreement in the instrumental case, which is far below the B2 standard. Second, it violates the instructions by providing duplicate options ('огромными' appears twice), making the choice ambiguous and the task poorly constructed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
|          14 | Llama 4         | Fill Blank      |       5 |      1.5  | This task has two significant issues. First, it violates guideline #7 regarding ambiguity. The verb 'пытался' is a direct synonym for 'старался' in this context and would be an equally correct answer. Second, it fails to adhere to guideline #9 by not including the feminine form 'старалась' in the array of correct answers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
|          14 | Mistral Large 3 | Multiple Choice |       4 |      2.87 | The task explicitly violates the guideline 'Do not include any instructions for the task' by starting the question with 'Выберите правильный вариант, чтобы завершить предложение:'. Furthermore, the grammatical point being tested (future tense agreement with 'много дел') is at an A2/B1 level, making it too simple for the specified B2 proficiency.                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
|          14 | Mistral Large 3 | Fill Blank      |       6 |      1.46 | The task is grammatically correct and unambiguous. However, it does not meet the B2 level requirement. The vocabulary ('погода', 'прогулка') and the grammatical structure (verb of motion after 'решить') are typically mastered at the B1 level. The context is too simple for a B2 learner described as being able to write essays and reports.                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
|          14 | Qwen 3 Max      | Multiple Choice |       2 |      4.73 | The task is fundamentally flawed. The provided correct answer, 'справиться', is grammatically incorrect in the given sentence, as it requires the preposition 'с' and the instrumental case, not the accusative case ('сложную ситуацию'). Another option, 'разрешить', fits perfectly, making the task incorrect and confusing. The core idea of testing vocabulary nuance is good, but the execution is poor.                                                                                                                                                              |

The vocabulary is appropriate. However, like Candidate 1, it fails to provide both possible gender forms for the past tense verb ('объяснил' and 'объяснила'), violating guideline #9. Additionally, another verb like 'рассказал' (told) could also fit, creating slight ambiguity.                                                                                                                                                             |

It successfully avoids including instructions in the question field, adhering to a key negative constraint.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
|          15 | GPT-5.2         | Fill Blank      |       8 |      1.35 | The task correctly tests a key B2 grammar point (verb aspect). The sentence structure and vocabulary are appropriate for the level. However, the answer is not strictly unique as instructed; another perfective verb like 'завершить' (a more formal synonym) would also be grammatically correct in this context, making the question slightly ambiguous.                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
|          15 | Gemini 3 Flash  | Multiple Choice |      10 |      1.42 | This is an outstanding candidate that perfectly matches all requirements. The task, which tests vocabulary and prepositional government ('аргументы в пользу'), is highly relevant to the B2 level, particularly the skill of presenting arguments in a report. The vocabulary is level-appropriate and sophisticated. The submission adheres strictly to all formatting and content guidelines, making it the best of the set.                                                                                                                                              |
|          15 | Gemini 3 Flash  | Fill Blank      |      10 |      1.08 | An outstanding task that aligns perfectly with the B2 proficiency description. It uses formal, academic language ('Принимая во внимание', 'приходит к выводу') and tests both vocabulary and grammar (genitive case in a comparative construction). The complex sentence structure and context make it an ideal B2-level question.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
|          15 | Llama 4         | Multiple Choice |       2 |      2.38 | This candidate fails on multiple critical points. The task is not deterministic and tests logical coherence rather than a specific grammar or vocabulary point, allowing for multiple valid answers. It violates instructions by including a prompt in the 'question' field. Furthermore, the JSON format is incorrect, containing a redundant and improperly structured nested field.                                                                                                                                                                                       |
|          15 | Llama 4         | Fill Blank      |       1 |      0.84 | This candidate fails on two fundamental requirements. Firstly, the JSON format is invalid, containing nested JSON as a string and a duplicate key. Secondly, the linguistic task itself, testing the basic possessive 'у меня есть', is at an A1 (beginner) level and is completely inappropriate for a B2 learner.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
|          15 | Mistral Large 3 | Multiple Choice |       6 |      2.79 | The linguistic task itself, testing the conditional mood, is appropriate for the B2 level. The JSON format also correctly interprets an ambiguous instruction regarding the 'correctAnswer' field. However, it is penalized for explicitly including instructions ('Выберите правильный вариант...') in the 'question' field, which violates a specific guideline.                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
|          15 | Mistral Large 3 | Fill Blank      |       9 |      2.08 | A very strong task. It effectively tests the distinction between imperfective ('достигать') and perfective verb aspects, a core B2 skill. The context makes the choice of the imperfective aspect for a general truth unambiguous. The topic and vocabulary are well-suited for the B2 level.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
|          15 | Qwen 3 Max      | Multiple Choice |       9 |      5    | An excellent candidate that adheres to all instructions. The complex sentence structure, testing the use of the infinitive after 'удалось', is perfectly suited for the B2 level. The context of receiving a letter aligns directly with the proficiency description provided in the prompt. The task is clear, deterministic, and well-formed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
|          15 | Qwen 3 Max      | Fill Blank      |      10 |      2.75 | An excellent task that is perfectly calibrated for the B2 level. It tests the use of adverbial participles ('деепричастия'), an advanced grammatical structure that is crucial for the formal writing skills described in the proficiency level. The answer is unambiguous and the context is very clear.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
