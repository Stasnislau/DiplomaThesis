The distractors are well-chosen and test understanding of conjunctions and linking words.

The sentence is natural and the context is appropriate. The primary weakness is that the answer is not strictly unique, as 'In spite of' is also a valid answer, which goes against the prompt's guideline for a deterministic answer.

      <td>This is a strong B2-level task testing connectors of concession ('despite' vs. 'in spite of'), which aligns well with the proficiency description of writing reports and giving reasons. The professional context is appropriate. The only minor weakness is that 'in spite of' is also a correct answer, but it was not included in the 'correctAnswer' array.

While 'factor' could also be a possible answer, 'take' is by far the most idiomatic and expected response, making this a strong, nearly deterministic question.</td>

      <td>8</td>
      <td>The task correctly targets a key B2 grammar point (third conditional). The sentence is natural and the answer 'had had' is deterministically correct. The score is slightly reduced because the 'had had' structure can be phonetically confusing, and the parenthetical hint `(had more time)` is a slightly awkward interpretation of the prompt's instruction to provide the 'missing word/phrase in English'.</td>

      <td>8</td>
      <td>The candidate produced a valid JSON with a high-quality B2-level question. The vocabulary item 'postpone' is appropriate for the level and context. However, it violates the strict instruction that the missing word must have only one correct answer, as 'delay' (the word in the hint) and 'reschedule' are also valid and natural-sounding options. Despite this flaw, it is a strong attempt at a challenging task.</td>

The vocabulary is appropriate and the answer is deterministic.</td>

The vocabulary and grammar are well-chosen. The only flaw is a minor formatting error where `correctAnswer` is provided as a string instead of an array.</td>

      <td>This is a strong submission that aligns excellently with the B2 level description, using a relevant context (writing a letter) and correctly providing both gender forms for the answer. However, it fails the strict non-ambiguity rule, as 'рассказал(а)' (told/narrated) is a very common and perfectly suitable alternative to 'объяснил(а)' (explained).</td>

      <td>Excellent task. It adheres to all guidelines, presenting a B2-level vocabulary question on collocations. The context of 'getting a job' described in a letter aligns well with the CEFR level description. The `correctAnswer` format is a string instead of an array, which is a minor format deviation.</td>

      <td>While the task attempts to use a B2-level context (report, arguments, project), the collocation 'поддержать свои аргументы' (to support one's arguments) is slightly unnatural in Russian. A more natural verb choice would be 'подкрепить' (to reinforce). This unnatural phrasing makes the task confusing and less effective for assessment.</td>

      <td>This task is fundamentally flawed because it is not deterministic. The choice between 'пошёл' and 'ходил' (verbs of motion) is highly context-dependent, and in this sentence, 'ходил' could also be argued as the correct answer, representing a completed round trip. A multiple-choice question must have a single, unambiguously correct answer. This ambiguity makes it a poor assessment item.</td>
